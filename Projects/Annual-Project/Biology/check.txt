Introduction
 
Waste management is a critical issue due to the increasing waste volumes and their environmental and health impacts. Effective waste management mitigates pollution, conserves resources, and protects ecosystems. This project explores composting and anaerobic digestion, which decompose organic waste into valuable end products.

Traditional waste disposal methods like landfilling and incineration pose environmental challenges, including greenhouse gas emissions and contamination. Biological waste management offers an eco-friendly alternative using natural decomposition by microorganisms. Composting transforms organic  waste into nutrient-rich compost, while anaerobic digestion produces biogas and digestate.

This project examines the efficiency, environmental impact, and economic viability of composting and anaerobic digestion. The methodology involves setting up compost bins and biogas plants, monitoring decomposition, identifying key microorganisms, and analyzing the products. These processes aim to transform waste into valuable resources, reduce pollution, and promote a circular economy.










Aim of the Experiment
 
The aim of this project is to investigate and analyze the current waste management practices in Tinsukia, Assam, to identify the key challenges and propose effective solutions for improving waste management. This includes examining the processes of waste collection, segregation, recycling, composting, and waste-to-energy technologies, with the ultimate goal of promoting sustainable waste management practices and enhancing public health and environmental protection. 
Need Statement

The management of waste is crucial due to its significant environmental, health, and economic impacts. Improper waste disposal leads to pollution, habitat destruction, and adverse health effects, necessitating efficient waste management practices to minimize these negative impacts.
Efficient waste management helps conserve resources and promotes sustainability. Traditional methods like landfilling and incineration  have numerous drawbacks, including greenhouse gas  emissions and soil contamination. Therefore, exploring alternative methods is vital for a sustainable future.
This project focuses on biological methods of waste management, specifically the roles of decomposition processes, recycling, and microorganisms. By examining these biological processes, we aim to develop sustainable waste management practices that reduce environmental impact and promote resource conservation.
