## Magnetic Braking System 
- Elevators:
    - When the elevator is moving down and needs to decelerate, a metallic disk or plate attached to the elevator shaft moves through a magnetic field generated by electromagnets.
    - As the metallic plate enters the magnetic field, eddy currents are induced in the plate. These currents create their own magnetic fields, which oppose the movement of the plate, as per Lenz's Law.
    - The opposing magnetic field slows down the rotation of the plate and thus the motion of the elevator, acting as a brake. Since there is no friction involved, it results in smooth, reliable braking with minimal wear and tear.
- Magnetic Sorting System
    1. **Non-Ferrous Metal Separation**: Magnetic sorting systems use Lenz's Law to separate non-ferrous metals, such as aluminum and copper, from waste streams. When these metals pass through a rapidly changing magnetic field, the induced eddy currents create opposing magnetic fields, which repel the metals, allowing them to be separated from non-metallic or ferrous materials.
    2. **Efficient Recycling**: Lenz's Law ensures that the magnetic sorting system is effective at recovering valuable non-ferrous metals in recycling operations. The induced repelling force allows the system to automatically divert these metals, enhancing the efficiency of waste management and reducing manual sorting efforts.
