| Function         | Not involved in protein coding    | Code for proteins          |

## 8. Why heterogeneous nuclear RNA is required to undergo splicing? 
Heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) undergoes splicing to remove introns and join exons together, forming mature mRNA. This process is essential to produce functional mRNA that can be translated into proteins.

## 9. Mention the different types of bonds existing in dsDNA. 
In double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), the different types of bonds include:

1. **Hydrogen Bonds**: These bonds form between complementary nitrogenous bases (A-T and G-C) across the two strands of the DNA double helix.
2. **Phosphodiester Bonds**: These bonds link the 3' carbon of one sugar molecule to the 5' carbon of the adjacent sugar molecule in the DNA backbone, forming the sugar-phosphate backbone.
3. **Base Pair Stacking Interactions**: These are non-covalent interactions between the aromatic rings of adjacent base pairs in the same strand, contributing to the stability of the DNA double helix.

## 10. When does DNA replicate in the cell cycle? 
DNA replication occurs during the S phase (Synthesis phase) of the cell cycle.

## 11. On which plant did Taylor and his colleagues perform their experiment? 
Taylor and his colleagues performed their experiment on *Vicia faba*

## 12. What is Ori? 
"Ori" typically refers to the origin of replication in DNA. It is a specific sequence of nucleotides where DNA replication begins.

## 13. Write the functions of Deoxyribonucleosidetriphosphate. 
Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) serve as substrates for DNA polymerase during DNA replication and repair. Their functions include:

1. Providing the building blocks (deoxyribonucleotides) needed to synthesize new DNA strands.
2. Serving as energy sources for the polymerization reaction during DNA synthesis.
3. Ensuring accuracy in DNA replication by complementary base pairing (A-T, G-C).

## 14. What are codons and anticodons? 
Codons and anticodons are specific sequences of nucleotides found in RNA molecules:

- **Codons**: These are sequences of three nucleotides (triplets) in mRNA that code for specific amino acids during protein synthesis. Each codon corresponds to a particular amino acid or a start/stop signal in translation.
- **Anticodons**: Found in tRNA molecules, anticodons are complementary to codons in mRNA. They ensure that the correct amino acid is brought to the ribosome during translation, based on the mRNA codon sequence.

## 15. Name the amino acids having only one codon. 
The amino acids that have only one codon (i.e., they are encoded by a single codon) are:

1. **Methionine (Met)**: Encoded by the codon AUG, which also serves as the start codon for protein synthesis.
2. **Tryptophan (Trp)**: Encoded by the codon UGG.

## 16. What do you mean by nonsense codon? 
A nonsense codon, also known as a stop codon or termination codon, is a specific sequence of three nucleotides (in mRNA) that signals the termination of protein synthesis during translation. These codons do not code for any amino acid but instead instruct the ribosome to release the newly synthesized polypeptide chain. There are three nonsense codons:

1. **UAA**
2. **UAG**
3. **UGA**

When a ribosome encounters a nonsense codon in the mRNA sequence, protein synthesis stops, and the nascent protein is released from the ribosome.

## 17. What is aminoacylation? 
Aminoacylation, or charging, is the process in which amino acids are covalently attached to their corresponding tRNA molecules by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes. This ensures that each tRNA carries the correct amino acid to the ribosome for incorporation into the growing polypeptide chain during translation.

## 18. Name the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of snRNA. 
The enzymes responsible for the synthesis of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) are RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III. These enzymes transcribe the genes that encode snRNAs, which are essential components of the spliceosome involved in RNA splicing.

## 19. Which chemical is used as an inducer in lac-operon and why is it considered an inducer? 
Lactose is considered an inducer in operons like the lac operon because it binds to the repressor protein, preventing it from blocking gene expression. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe genes involved in lactose metabolism.

## 20. Name the processes involved during the transformation of hnRNA to mRNA. 
During the transformation of heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) into messenger RNA (mRNA), several processes occur:

1. **Capping**: Addition of a 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the mRNA molecule.
   
2. **Tailing**: Addition of a polyadenylate (poly-A) tail at the 3' end of the mRNA molecule.
   
3. **Splicing**: Removal of introns (non-coding regions) and joining of exons (coding regions) to form mature mRNA.
   
These processes collectively ensure that the mRNA molecule is modified and processed appropriately for efficient translation into proteins.

## 21. How many base pairs are there in one nucleosome and one complete turn of dsDNA? 
In a nucleosome:

- There are approximately 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around the histone octamer.

In one complete turn of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA):

- There are approximately 10.5 base pairs per turn.

## 22. Explain two factors responsible for conferring stability of the double helix structure of DNA. 
Two factors significantly contribute to the stability of the DNA double helix:

1. **Hydrogen Bonds**: A pairs with T via two hydrogen bonds, and G pairs with C via three hydrogen bonds, tightly binding the two strands together.

2. **Base Pair Stacking**: Aromatic rings of adjacent base pairs engage in pi-stacking interactions, which stabilize the structure by minimizing hydrophobic exposure.

## 23. State the role of DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and DNA ligase in the replication of DNA.
- **DNA-dependent DNA polymerase**: This enzyme synthesizes new DNA strands using existing strands as templates. It adds complementary nucleotides and proofreads to ensure accurate replication.

- **DNA ligase**: DNA ligase joins Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand by forming phosphodiester bonds, completing the synthesis of a continuous double-stranded DNA molecule.

## 24. A segment of DNA has a total of 2000 nucleotides, out of which 520 are adenine-containing nucleotides. How many purine bases does this DNA segment possess? 
Given,   
Nucleotides = 2000  
Adenine = 520 

$\therefore \text{Thymine} = 520$

$G \text{ and } C \text{ bases} = 2000 - (520 \times 2) = 960$

$\text{Guanine bases} = 960/2=480$

$\therefore \text{Total purine bases} = 520+480=1000\text{ bases}$

## 25. 5' TACGTAAACCGAAAG 3'. Find out the mRNA and anticodons from the above information. 
To find the mRNA sequence and the corresponding anticodons from the given DNA sequence (5' TACGTAAACCGAAAG 3'), we follow these steps:

1. **Transcribe the DNA sequence to mRNA**:
   - DNA sequence: 5' TACGTAAACCGAAAG 3'
   - mRNA sequence (replace T with U): 5' UACGUAAACCGAAAG 3'

2. **Determine the anticodons**:
   - mRNA sequence: 5' UACGUAAACCGAAAG 3'
   - Anticodons (complementary to codons in mRNA):
     - UAC (for AUG codon, which codes for methionine)
     - GUU (for CAA codon, which codes for glutamine)
     - UUG (for CCG codon, which codes for proline)

Therefore, the mRNA sequence is 5' UACGUAAACCGAAAG 3', and the corresponding anticodons are UAC, GUU, and UUG. These anticodons would be found on tRNA molecules that carry methionine, glutamine, and proline, respectively, during protein synthesis.

## 26. How are structural genes inactivated in lac-operon in e-coli? 
In lac-operon of e-coli, in absence of lactose, the repressor protein that get produces by the mRNA binds with the operator region of the mRNA and stops the translation of structural genes lac Z, Y and A. Thus, the structural gene gets inactivated.

- **Evolutionary Studies**: SNPs provide insights into evolutionary relationships and population genetics.

## 30. What are the two approaches or methodologies of HGP? 
The two main approaches or methodologies of the Human Genome Project (HGP) were:

1. **Expressed Gene Tags:** to identify all genes that are expressed as RNA (mapping). 

2. **Sequence annotation:** Blindly approach sequencing whole set of genome that contained all coding and non-coding sequences and later assigning different regions in the sequence with functions. 

These approaches were complementary, with mapping providing the framework and sequence annotation providing the detailed nucleotide sequences, leading to the successful completion of the Human Genome Project.

## 31. Microscopic pollen of the past are obtained as fossils. Mention the characteristics of the pollen grain that make it happen. 
Pollen grains are preserved as fossils due to their decay-resistant exine, small size, and sporopollenin composition. Their abundance and widespread distribution enhance fossilization, making them excellent indicators of past vegetation and environmental conditions.


## 32. State the function of the Filliform Apparatus. 
The term "filiform apparatus" refers to a structure found in the embryo sac (female gametophyte) of flowering plants. Its function is to guide the pollen tube to the embryo sac during fertilization. The filiform apparatus consists of specialized cells that help direct the pollen tube towards the micropyle of the ovule, facilitating successful fertilization and seed development in flowering plants.

## 33. Papaver and Michelia both have multi-carpellary ovaries. How do they differ from each other? 
Papaver (poppy) and Michelia are both plants with multi-carpellary ovaries, but they differ in several aspects:

1. **Flower Structure**: Papaver has multiple pistils arranged in a whorl or cluster, while Michelia has a single compound pistil with fused carpels.

2. **Ovary Arrangement**: Papaver's pistils are separate or partially fused; Michelia's carpels are fused into a single ovary.

3. **Fruit Type**: Papaver produces a capsule, whereas Michelia often develops a berry-like or multiple fruit cluster.

These differences highlight variations in floral morphology and reproductive structures between the two genera despite both having multi-carpellary ovaries.

## 34. A bilobed dithaceous anther has 100 microspore mother cells per microsporangium. How many male gametes can this anther produce? 
A bilobed dithaceous anther typically consists of two lobes, each containing microsporangia where microspore mother cells undergo meiosis to produce microspores. Given that each microsporangium has 100 microspore mother cells, we can calculate the total number of male gametes produced as follows:

Since each microspore mother cell undergoes meiosis to produce 4 microspores, and each microspore develops into a male gametophyte (pollen grain) containing 2 male gametes (sperm cells), we calculate:

$\text{Total male gametes produced} = 100 \text{ microspore mother cells per microsporangium} \times 4 \text{ microspores per microspore mother cell} \times 2 \text{ male gametes per microspore} \times 2 \text{ lobes}$

$\text{Total male gametes produced} = 100 \times 4 \times 2 \times 2 = 1600$

Therefore, a bilobed dithaceous anther with 100 microspore mother cells per microsporangium can produce a total of 1600 male gametes.

## 35. How is it possible in Oxalis and Viola plants to produce assured seed sets in the absence of pollinators? 
Oxalis and Viola plants ensure seed production without pollinators through cleistogamy. Cleistogamous flowers, found in both species, remain closed and self-pollinate inside the flower bud. This adaptation allows them to produce seeds reliably even when pollinators are scarce or conditions are unfavorable for open flowers.

## 36. What are the different layers of anther and mention the function of each. 
The anther, which is the male reproductive structure of flowering plants, consists of several layers, each with specific functions:

1. **Epidermis**: The outermost layer of the anther.
   - **Function**: Provides protection and structural support to the internal tissues of the anther.

2. **Endothecium**: A layer of cells located just beneath the epidermis.
   - **Function**: Helps in the dehiscence (splitting open) of the anther during pollen release.

3. **Middle Layer (or Midlayer)**: Located between the endothecium and the tapetum.
   - **Function**: Provides structural support to the anther and may have a role in nutrient transport to developing pollen grains.

4. **Tapetum**: The innermost layer surrounding the microspore mother cells.
   - **Function**: Provides nutrition and support to the developing pollen grains. It also produces enzymes and proteins that aid in the development and maturation of pollen, including the formation of pollen coat and intine layers.

5. **Microspore Mother Cells (MMC)**: Found inside the anther sac.
   - **Function**: Undergo meiosis to produce microspores, which eventually develop into pollen grains.

These layers work together to support the development and maturation of pollen grains within the anther, ensuring successful reproduction in flowering plants.

## 37. The meiocyte of rice has 24 chromosomes. How many chromosomes are there in its endosperm? 
In rice (Oryza sativa), the endosperm typically contains a different chromosome number compared to the meiocyte (microspore mother cell) due to a phenomenon called "double fertilization." Here's how the chromosome numbers are distributed:

1. **Meiocyte (Microspore Mother Cell)**:
   - Contains 24 chromosomes. These chromosomes undergo meiosis to produce haploid microspores, each containing 12 chromosomes.

2. **Endosperm**:
   - The endosperm in rice is triploid, meaning it contains three sets of chromosomes.
   - The endosperm results from the fusion of one sperm nucleus (from pollen) with two polar nuclei (in the embryo sac).
   - Therefore, the chromosome number in the endosperm is typically 3 times the haploid number of chromosomes in the microspore, which is 12.
   - So, the endosperm of rice generally contains $( 3 \times 12 = 36 )$ chromosomes.

Therefore, while the meiocyte of rice has 24 chromosomes, the endosperm typically contains 36 chromosomes due to its triploid nature resulting from double fertilization.

## 38. Write any two advantages and disadvantages of cleistogamous flowers. 
**Advantages of Cleistogamous Flowers:**

1. **Assured Seed Production**: Ensure seeds even in adverse conditions or without pollinators.
2. **Pollinator Independence**: Reduce reliance on unpredictable or absent pollinators.

**Disadvantages of Cleistogamous Flowers:**

1. **Reduced Genetic Diversity**: Lead to lower genetic diversity over time.
2. **Limited Outcrossing**: Restrict opportunities for beneficial genetic recombination.

## 39. What is pollen-pistil interaction? 
Pollen-pistil interaction in flowering plants involves biochemical and physiological processes during fertilization, including pollen adhesion to the stigma, germination, and tube guidance towards the ovule, where sperm cells are released for fertilization. These interactions ensure the transfer and fusion of genetic material, leading to seed development, while incompatible pollen is recognized and rejected to prevent unsuccessful fertilization.

## 40. Give an example of cellular and free nuclear endosperm.

1. **Cellular Endosperm**: This type of endosperm is found in plants like maize (corn). In maize, the endosperm is initially multinucleate but undergoes cellularization, where cell walls form around individual nuclei, resulting in a cellular structure with distinct cells containing one or a few nuclei each. This type of endosperm provides nutrients to the developing embryo and eventually the seedling.

2. **Free Nuclear Endosperm**: An example of free nuclear endosperm is found in species like coconut (Cocos nucifera). In free nuclear endosperm, the nuclei undergo multiple rounds of mitosis without cytokinesis, resulting in a multinucleate mass of cytoplasm without distinct cell boundaries. This type of endosperm is characteristic of species where the nuclei remain free in a common cytoplasmic matrix, providing nutrition to the developing embryo.

## 41. Name the type of pollination in self-incompatible plants. 
In self-incompatible plants, the type of pollination that typically occurs is **cross-pollination**. This is because self-incompatible plants have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination or self-fertilization to maintain genetic diversity and avoid inbreeding depression. These plants often rely on pollinators or other external agents to transfer pollen between different individuals of the same species, ensuring successful fertilization.

## 42. How does polyembryony arise in citrus plants? 
Polyembryony in citrus plants occurs through two main mechanisms:

1. **Nucellar Embryony**: Common in oranges and lemons, where cells from the nucellus form multiple embryos alongside the zygotic embryo, resulting in clones of the mother plant.

2. **Adventitious Embryony**: Involves the development of embryos from somatic cells within the ovule or surrounding tissues, contributing additional embryos.

These mechanisms ensure genetic uniformity and enhance reproductive success by producing multiple offspring from a single seed.

## 43. What are tassels of corn-cob? 
In maize (corn), the tassel is the male inflorescence at the top of the plant, consisting of a central stalk with branches bearing spikelets that contain male flowers. Its primary function is to produce and release pollen, which is dispersed by wind and gravity to the silks (female flowers) on the ear of the plant. Tassels develop and mature before the ears, ensuring timely pollination and fertilization. This process is crucial for the development of kernels on the cob.

## 44. What is common in apomixis and parthenocarpic fruits? 
Apomixis and parthenocarpic fruits both involve reproduction or fruit development without fertilization:

1. **Apomixis**: Asexual reproduction where embryos develop from unfertilized ovule cells, resulting in seeds genetically identical to the parent plant.

2. **Parthenocarpic Fruits**: Fruits develop from ovules without fertilization, often resulting in seedless or underdeveloped seeds.

Both processes avoid fertilization, leading to offspring or fruit without male-female gamete fusion, benefiting agriculture with seedless fruits and genetic uniformity.

## 45. Mention the location and function of the Leydig cell. 
Leydig cells, located in the connective tissue around the seminiferous tubules in the testes, produce testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. This testosterone is crucial for male reproductive tissue development, maintenance, and secondary sexual characteristics such as facial hair, deep voice, and muscle growth.

## 46. Write any two functions performed by Sertoli cells. 
Sertoli cells, also known as sustentacular cells, perform several important functions in the testes:

1. **Nurturing Spermatogenesis**: Sertoli cells support spermatogenesis by providing nutrients, growth factors, and hormones to developing sperm within the seminiferous tubules.

2. **Barrier Function**: Sertoli cells form tight junctions, creating a blood-testis barrier that protects developing sperm from immune attacks and prevents antibodies and toxins from entering the seminiferous tubules.

## 47. Name the embryonic stage that gets implanted in the uterine wall. 
The embryonic stage that gets implanted in the uterine wall is called the **blastocyst**. The blastocyst is an early stage of embryonic development characterized by a hollow ball of cells with an inner cell mass (embryoblast) that will develop into the embryo itself, and an outer layer of cells called the trophoblast, which plays a role in implantation and later forms part of the placenta.

## 48. What is Corpus Luteum? Mention its function. 
The corpus luteum is a temporary endocrine structure that forms in the ovary after ovulation. Here are its key aspects:

- **Function**: The corpus luteum primarily produces progesterone, which is crucial for preparing and maintaining the uterine lining (endometrium) for implantation of a fertilized egg.

## 49. Mention the importance of LH-surge. 
The LH (luteinizing hormone) surge is crucial in females for triggering ovulation, forming the corpus luteum, and producing progesterone to prepare the uterus for potential pregnancy. It also plays a vital role in regulating the menstrual cycle and maintaining reproductive health.

## 50. Why are the human testis located outside the abdominal cavity? Mention the pouch in which they are present.
The human testes are located in the scrotum outside the abdominal cavity to maintain a cooler temperature essential for spermatogenesis, protect the testes, and support sperm maturation, ensuring the production of viable sperm for reproduction.
