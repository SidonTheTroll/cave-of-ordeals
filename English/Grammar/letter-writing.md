Subject: Urging the news channels to create a healthy balance between news and commercials. 

Sir
Through the columns of your esteemed daily, I would like to raise the issue of Indian News channels airing more commercials than news in their channels.

Therefore I urge you to pursue these channels to bring a healthy balance between news and ads so that the common man can have a trustful source of information without financially affecting the income of the news channels. 

Thanking you

Yours sincerely 

John
