**Subject: Urging the news channels to create a healthy balance between news and commercials**

**Sir,**

Through the columns of your esteemed daily, I would like to raise the issue of Indian news channels airing more commercials than news. 

This trend has become increasingly concerning as it disrupts the flow of information and diminishes the quality of news coverage. Viewers are often bombarded with advertisements, making it difficult to stay informed on important issues. While I understand that commercials are essential for the financial sustainability of these channels, the excessive frequency of ads has led to a situation where the primary purpose of these news channels seems compromised and become commercial-primary channels. 

Therefore, I urge you to appeal to these channels to strike a healthy balance between news and advertisements. This balance will ensure that viewers have access to reliable information without significantly impacting the revenue of the news channels.

Thanking you

Yours sincerely  
John
