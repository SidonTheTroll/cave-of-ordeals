## 2. Do you think the poet advocates total inactivity and death?
No, the poet doesn't advocate total inactivity or death. He says that 'stillness' shouldn't be confused with 'total inactivity' which means death. His stillness indicates the halting of hostile and harmful human activities. 

## 3. What is the 'sadness' that the poet refers to in the poem? 
The 'sadness' of men is formed by their thoughts and activities. All disasters are created by man. Had men been not so single-minded in their pursuit of their goals, they wouldn't have been engulfed by sadness and wouldn't have threatened themselves with death. 

## 4. What symbol from Nature does the poet invoke to say that there can be life under apparent stillness? 
The poet invokes the Earth is a living symbol. Prove his point that there can be life under apparent stillness. During the autumn season, the Earth remains still and barren. However, it never attains total inactivity. Nature remains at work even under apparent stillness as during the spring season, the Earth springs back to life with double energy and vigor. In the spring season, mother nature is seen to be bountiful and abundant.
