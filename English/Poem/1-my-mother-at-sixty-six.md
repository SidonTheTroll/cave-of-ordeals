# My Mother at Sixty Six 

### 3. Why has the poet brought in the image of the merry children 'spilling out of their homes'? 
In the poem, the poet contrasts life and death, using the lively image of children rushing out of their homes to play to symbolize vitality and joy. This scene contrasts with the poet's mother inside the car, emphasizing the contrast between youth and age.

### 4. Why has the mother been compared to the 'late winter's moon'? 
The poet compares her mother to the "late winter's moon," highlighting her aging and the resulting paleness and dullness of her skin, similar to the moon's dull appearance. This comparison emphasizes the similarity between aging and decay, as both the late winter moon and the poet's mother's face appear faint and lacking vitality.

### 5. What do the parting words of the poet and her smile signify? 
The poet's parting words, "see you soon Amma," convey both farewell and a desire to leave her mother with hope, despite knowing her advanced age and uncertain future. The repetition of "smile" in her farewell reflects the poet's attempt to hide her worries about her mother's mortality, while also empathizing with her loneliness in old age.
