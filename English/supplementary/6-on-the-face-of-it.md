# On the Face of it
## 1. Who is Mr. Lamb? How does Derry get into his garden?
Mr. Lamb is an old man who lost his leg in the war and now uses a tin leg. He lives alone near a garden with ripe crab apples. While sitting in the garden, he sees Derry, a boy who climbs over the wall despite the open gate.

## 2. Do you think all this will change Derry's attitude towards Mr. Lamb?
Yes, this will change Derry’s attitude. Derry’s burnt face made him feel mocked and disliked, leading to a negative outlook on life. Unlike others, Mr. Lamb treated him as an equal and encouraged him to embrace life and self-acceptance. Over time, Derry grew to respect and like Mr. Lamb for his kindness and wisdom.

## 3. What is it that draws Derry towards Mr. Lamb inspite of himself? 
Derry, with a burnt face, feels depressed and hated, even doubted by his parents. Mr. Lamb, with a tin leg, encourages him to enjoy life despite challenges, sharing his own resilience. Mr. Lamb's positivity inspires Derry and changes his outlook.

## 4. In which section of the play does Mr. Lamb display signs of loneliness and disappointment? What are the ways in which Mr. Lamb tries to overcome these feelings? 
In the first scene, we see Mr. Lamb's loneliness. He tells Derry he plans to pick crab apples and make jelly, inviting him to help. He expresses interest in everything created by God, from people to nature. He enjoys sitting in the sun, reading, and keeping his house open to light and darkness. These reflect both his loneliness and how he copes with it.

## 5. The actual pain or inconvenience caused by a physical impairment is often much less than the sense of alteration felt by the person with disabilities. What is the kind of behavior that the person expects from others? 
The story highlights the harsh reality of life for disabled people. They endure not only physical pain but also emotional suffering due to society's cruel behavior. Derry is shunned for his burnt face, while Mr. Lamb is mocked as 'Lamey Lamb' and lives alone. Their alienation causes deep pain. Disabled individuals seek not sympathy but fair and normal treatment from others.

## 6. Will Derry get back to his old seclusion or will Mr. Lamb's brief association effect a change in the kind of life he will lead in the future? 
Derry won’t return to his seclusion. Mr. Lamb boosted his confidence, teaching him self-respect and to focus on his strengths, not his appearance. This change in Derry is permanent and won’t be undone, even after Mr. Lamb’s death.
