# Journey to the End of the Earth 
## 1. How do geological phenomena help us to know about the history of humankind? 
The separation of continents from a single landmass reveals Earth's history. About 650 million years ago, humans didn't exist due to an unfavorable environment. After dinosaurs became extinct, mammals emerged, and the human race began flourishing following the landmass separation.

## 2. What are the indications for the future of humankind? 
Environmental changes like rising temperatures, melting glaciers, climate change, increased carbon emissions, and ozone depletion signal the need to improve Earth's environmental health else the consequences would be disastrous.

## 3. 'The world's geological history is trapped to Antarctica.' How is the study of this region useful to us? 
Visiting Antarctica offers insight into Earth's past and future, highlighting geological features, ozone, carbon, evolution, and extinction. It showcases scales from microscopic mites to blue whales and country-sized icebergs. The 24-hour Antarctic summer light and pervasive silence, broken only by avalanches or calving ice sheets, immerse visitors in Earth's geological history.

## 4. What are Geoff Green's reasons for including high school students in the *Students on Ice* expedition? 
Geoff Green's *Students on Ice* program offers young future policy-makers a transformative experience, fostering education, understanding and respect for the planet at a pivotal age to inspire action.

## 5. 'Take care of the small things and the big things will take care of themselves.' What is the relevance of this statement in the context of the Antarctic environment? 
This sentence emphasizes that caring for small habits that harm the environment can help address major issues like climate change, glacier melting, rising temperatures, and wildlife extinction, promoting environmental protection.

## 6. Why is Antarctica the place to go to, to understand the earth's present, past and future? 
Antarctica reveals how Earth looked millions of years ago and its division into continents. Melting ice warns of future consequences if we disrupt nature. Its ice holds half-million-year-old carbon records, helping us understand Earth's past, present, and future.
