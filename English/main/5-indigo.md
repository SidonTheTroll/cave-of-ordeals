## 4. What did the peasants pay the British landlords as rent? What did the British now want instead and why? What would be the impact of synthetic indigo on the prices of natural indigo?

## 5. The events in this part of the text illustrate Gandhi's method of working. Can you identify some instances of this method and link them to the ideas of Satyagraha and non-violence? 
Gandhi's politics tackled everyday issues for millions of Indians. He opposed unjust laws and willingly faced imprisonment, as seen in the Dandi March against the 'Salt Law.' His approach, rooted in Satyagraha and non-violence, sought truth and justice.

## 6. Why did Gandhi agree to a settlement of a 25% refund to the farmers?

## 10. What was the attitude of the average Indian in smaller localities towards advocates of 'home rule'? 
Indians in smaller areas feared supporting home rule. Gandhi stayed for two days with Professor Malkani in Muzaffarpur, which was notable since Malkani, a government teacher, sheltered someone opposing the government.

Professor J.B. Kriplani and a large group of students welcomed Gandhi at Muzaffarpur station at midnight. Sharecroppers and local lawyers also visited him. At Motihari station, a vast crowd greeted him, showcasing strong grassroots support for India's freedom movement.
