Displaced by floods in Bangladesh, Saheb and his family moved to Seemapuri, a Delhi slum, seeking survival.

### 2. What explanations does the author offer for the children not wearing footwear? 
As per the author, one reason for the consistent practice of being shoeless is that it's a custom among the underprivileged kids of this nation. Yet, the author promptly suggests that labeling it as a tradition might simply serve as an excuse for their ongoing poverty.

Saheb's full name was Saheb-e-Alam, meaning "Lord of the Universe," was deeply ironic. A penniless ragpicker without even sandals, his grand name starkly contrasted with his inability to meet basic needs as he didn't knew the meaning of his name.

### 6. Explain "For children garbage has a meaning different from what it means to their parents."
Young children eagerly probe through garbage, hoping to find coins, notes, or small treasures. Even a single rupee or a ten-rupee note sparks their hope and excitement, making garbage a source of fascination and wonder.

Saheb now earns 800 rupees and gets meals, ensuring food is no longer a worry. Yet, his carefree expression is gone. The steel canister he carries feels burdensome, symbolizing lost freedom. No longer his own master, longer hours and helplessness weigh on him, filling him with sadness.
