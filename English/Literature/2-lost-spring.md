## 'Sometimes I find a Rupee in the Garbage'

### 1. What is Saheb looking for in the garbage dumps? Where is he and where has he come from? 

Saheb was looking for gold or something valuable in the garbage dumps.  
Saheb and his family relocated to Seemapuri, a slum area on the edges of Delhi, searching for a means of survival after they were displaced from their hometown in Bangladesh because of floods.

### 2. What explanations does the author offer for the children not wearing footwear? 

As per the author, one reason for the consistent practice of being shoeless is that it's a custom among the underprivileged kids of this nation. Yet, the author promptly suggests that labeling it as a tradition might simply serve as an excuse for their ongoing poverty.

### 3. Is Saheb happy working at the tea stall? Explain. 

Saheb isn't particularly happy with his job at the tea stall because serving under a boss means giving up his freedom and his "carefree appearance." Despite earning 800 rupees and receiving all his meals, he appears less satisfied than he did before.

### 4. Who was Saheb? What was he doing and why? 

Saheb was a young boy around school age. He was probing the garbage dumps of the bustling city in search of something valuable. Leaving his home in   Bangladesh, he ventured to the city in search of a livelihood. With no other options, he resorted to collecting scraps.

### 5. What is the meaning of Saheb's full name? Does he know it? 

Saheb's full name was Saheb-e-Alam, signifying "the Lord of the Universe." The irony in Saheb's name lay in the fact that he was a penniless ragpicker who couldn't even afford sandals. Despite his name suggesting gloriousness, the truth was that he lacked the funds to fulfill even his most fundamental requirements.

### 6. Explain "For children garbage has a meaning different from what it means to their parents."

Young children eagerly search through piles of garbage, hoping to discover something valuable like coins, notes, or treasures. Even finding just a single rupee or a ten rupee note fills them with hope and anticipation for more. Thus, for children, garbage represents a source of fascination and wonder.

On the contrary, for adults, it serves as a lifeline for survival. They earn their livelihood from it. Therefore, garbage holds two distinct interpretations for children and their parents.

### 7. Where does the author find Saheb one winter morning? What explanations does Saheb reach? 

The writer spots Saheb standing near the gated/fenced entrance of a local club, watching two youths clad in white engaged in a game of tennis. Saheb expresses his fondness for the game but is satisfied to watch from behind the fence. He only enters the premises when it's empty. The gatekeeper allows him to use the swing inside.

### 8. How has 'a dream come true' for Saheb but what is 'out of his reach'? 

Saheb wears worn-out tennis shoes, one of which has a hole. For someone accustomed to going barefoot, even shoes with a hole represent a dream fulfilled. However, the game of tennis, which he watches so attentively, remains beyond his grasp.

### 9. How has Saheb's life changed when he starts working at the tea stall? 

Now, Saheb earns a steady income of 800 rupees along with all his meals, ensuring that food is no longer a concern. However, his countenance no longer bears the carefree expression it once did. The steel canister in his hand now feels like a burden, symbolizing his loss of freedom. He is no longer his own master and may be required to work longer hours. The sense of helplessness in being unable to act according to his own will fills him with sadness.

### 10. Why do the bangle makers not organized themselves into a cooperative? 

The bangle makers couldn't come together to form a cooperative because they were stuck in a harmful cycle involving moneylenders, middlemen, police, government officials, and politicians. If they attempted to organize, the police would beat them up and throw them in jail.

### 11. Which two distinct worlds does the author notice among the bangle making industry? 

The author observed two different worlds. One was the world of a family trapped in poverty and weighed down by the discrimination of the caste they were born into. The other was a cycle involving moneylenders, middlemen, police, law enforcers, government officials, and politicians. Together, these worlds would burden a child so heavily that they wouldn't be able to divert from a low-pay profession and become a bangle maker as easily as their father has.
