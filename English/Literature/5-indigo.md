Gandhi first met Shukla in Lucknow. He then traveled across India, returning to his ashram near Ahmedabad. Later, he went to Calcutta, Patna, and Muzaffarpur before arriving in Champaran.

## 4. What did the peasants pay the British landlords as rent? What did the British now want instead and why? What would be the impact of synthetic indigo on the prices of natural indigo? 
The peasants paid rent to British landlords with indigo. With Germany developing synthetic indigo, landlords demanded money instead to be released from the 15% arrangement, as the price of natural indigo was expected to drop.

## 5. The events in this part of the text illustrate Gandhi's method of working. Can you identify some instances of this method and link them to the ideas of Satyagraha and non-violence? 
Gandhi's politics addressed everyday problems of millions of Indians. He opposed unjust laws and was willing to be jailed for breaking them. The Dandi March against the 'Salt Law' exemplifies his peaceful resistance. His approach was rooted in Satyagraha and non-violence, aiming for truth and justice.

## 6. Why did Gandhi agree to a settlement of a 25% refund to the farmers?

## 7. How did the episode change the plight of the peasants? 
The peasants were spared the expense and time of court cases. Eventually, the British planters relinquished control of their estates, which reverted to the peasants, ending indigo sharecropping.

## 8. Why do you think Gandhi considered the Champaran episode to be a turning point in his life? 
The Champaran episode began as an effort to alleviate the suffering of many poor peasants and gained the spontaneous support of thousands. Gandhi called his actions ordinary but declared that the British could not command him in his own country, marking Champaran as a turning point in his life.

## 9. How was Gandhi able to influence lawyers? Give instances. 
Gandhi asked the lawyers what they would do if he were imprisoned. Initially, they said they'd return home. When Gandhi questioned the injustice to the sharecroppers, they realized it would be shameful to leave and told Gandhi they would follow him to jail.

## 10. What was the attitude of the average Indian in smaller localities towards advocates of 'home rule'? 
Average Indians in smaller areas feared supporting home rule advocates. Gandhi stayed for two days with Professor Malkani in Muzaffarpur, which was unusual because Malkani, a government school teacher, sheltered someone opposing the government.

## 11. How do we know that ordinary people too contributed to the freedom movement? 
Professor J.B. Kriplani welcomed Gandhi at Muzaffarpur railway station at midnight, accompanied by a large group of students. Sharecroppers from Champaran and local lawyers also visited him. Upon Gandhi's arrival at Motihari railway station, a vast multitude greeted him, with thousands demonstrating around the courtroom, highlighting the significant grassroots support for India's freedom movement.
