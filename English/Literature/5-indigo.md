## 4. What did the peasants pay the British landlords as rent? What did the British now want instead and why? What would be the impact of synthetic indigo on the prices of natural indigo? 
The peasants paid the British landlords indigo as rent. Now, Germany has developed synthetic indigo. So, the British landlords wanted money as compensation for being released from the 15% arrangement. The prices of natural indigo would go down due to synthetic indigo. 

## 5. The events in this part of the text illustrate Gandhi's method of working. Can you identify some instances of this method and link them to the ideas of Satyagraha and non-violence? 
Gandhi's politics was intermingled with the day-to-day problems of the millions of Indians. He opposed unjust laws. He was ready to court arrest for breaking such laws and going to jail. The famous Dandi March to break the 'Salt Law' is another instance. The resistance and disobedience were peaceful and fought for truth and justice. This was linked directly to his ideas of Satyagraha and non-violence. 

## 6. Why did Gandhi agree to a settlement of a 25% refund to the farmers? 
For Gandhi, the amount of the refund was less important than the fact that the landlords had been forced to return part of the money and with it, part of their prestige too. So, he agreed to a settlement of a 25% refund to the farmers. 

## 7. How did the episode change the plight of the peasants? 
The peasants were saved from spending time and money on court cases. After some years the British planters gave up control of their estates. These now reverted to the peasants. Indigo sharecropping disappeared. 

## 8. Why do you think Gandhi considered the Champaran episode to be a turning point in his life? 
The Champaran episode began as an attempt to ease the suffering of a large number of poor peasants. He got the spontaneous support of thousands of people. Gandhi admits that what he had done was a very ordinary thing. He declared that the British could not order him about in his own country. Hence, he considered the Champaran episode as a turning point in his life. 

## 9. How was Gandhi able to influence lawyers? Give instances. 
Gandhi asked the lawyers what they would do if he was sentenced to prison. They said that they had come to advise him. If he went to jail, they would go home. Then Gandhi asked them about the injustice to the sharecroppers. They concluded that it would be shameful desertion if they went home. So, they told Gandhi that they were ready to follow him into jail. 

## 10. What was the attitude of the average Indian in smaller localities towards advocates of 'home rule'? 
The average Indians in smaller localities were afraid to show sympathy for the advocates of home rule. Gandhi stayed at Muzaffarpur for two days at the home of ProfessorMalkani, a teacher in a government school. It was an extraordinary thing in those days for a government professor to give shelter to one who opposed the government. 

## 11. How do we know that ordinary people too contributed to the freedom movement? 
Professor J.B. Kriplani received Gandhi at Muzaffarpur railway station at midnight. He had a large body of students with him. Sharecroppers from Champaran came on foot and by conveyance to see Gandhi. Muzaffarpur lawyers too called on him. A vast multitude greeted Gandhi when he reached Motihari railway station. Thousands of people demonstrated around the court room. This shows that ordinary people too contributed to the freedom movement of India.
