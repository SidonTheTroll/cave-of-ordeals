# Deep Water 

### 1. What is the "misadventure" that William Douglas speaks about? 

The author recalls an incident at a swimming pool where he narrowly escaped drowning, labeling it a 'misadventure'. At the tender age of around ten or eleven, he had just begun to dabble in swimming, mainly through imitation. Unexpectedly tossed into the water by someone, lacking proper swimming skills, he found himself struggling to stay afloat.

### 2. What were the series of emotions and fears that Douglas experienced when he was thrown into the pool? What plans did he make to come to the surface? 

Initially, William Douglas experienced a mild fright as he started sinking, but his anxiety escalated as he took longer to descend to the pool's nine-foot depth. In response, he formulated a plan to exert all his strength: once reaching the pool's bottom, he resolved to leap upward, propelling himself to the surface.

### 3. How did this experience affect him? 

The near-death drowning experience deeply affected him psychologically, disrupting his emotional balance for many years. He avoided any water-related activities as the mere proximity to water was intolerable for him.

### 4. Why was Douglas determined to get over his fear of water? 

Douglas lamented the loss of opportunities to enjoy water activities such as canoeing, boating, swimming, and fishing. He longed to regain his lost confidence and overcome his fear of water, driving him to explore every possible avenue to conquer it.

### 5. How did the instructor "build a swimmer" out of Douglas? 

The instructor meticulously and patiently molded Douglas into a swimmer. For three months, he didn't even require Douglas to submerge his face in the water. Instead, he trained him using a rope attached to Douglas's belt, which went over a pulley on an overhead cable.

### 6. How did Douglas make sure that he conquered the old terror?

To confirm that he had truly overcome his fear, Douglas ventured to Lake Wentworth in New Hampshire. He dove in and swam two miles across the lake to Stamp Act Island. It was only when he found himself in the middle of the lake that the terror resurfaced momentarily.
