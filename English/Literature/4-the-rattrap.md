# The Rattrap 

## 1. From where did the peddler get the idea of the world being a rattrap? 
While thinking of his rattraps, the peddler was struck by the idea that the whole world was nothing but a big rattrap. It sets bait for people by offering riches, joys, shelter, food, heat and clothing in the same manner as a rattrap that offers cheese and pork. As soon as someone is tempted to touch the bait, it closes in on him, and then everything comes to an end. 

## 2. Why was he amused by this idea? 
The peddler's life was sad and monotonous; walking laboriously from place to place and never experiencing kindness. So, during his gloomy ploddings, the idea became his favorite pastime. He was amused by how people let themselves be caught in the snare and how others keep circling the bait. 

## 3. Did the peddler expect the kind of hospitality that he received from the crofter? 
The crofter served him porridge for supper and tobacco for his pipe. He also played a game of cards with him till bedtime. This hospitality was unexpected as people usually made sour faces when the peddler asked for shelter. 

## 4. Why was the crofter so talkative and friendly with the peddler? 
The crofter, lonely without a wife or child, was eager for company and generously shared his confidence, making him talkative and friendly with the peddler.

## 5. Why did he show the thirty kronor to the peddler? 
To assure the skeptical peddler, the crofter showed him the thirty kronor he had earned from supplying his cow's milk to the creamery. 

## 6. Did the peddler respect the confidence reposed in him by the crofter? 
No, the peddler betrayed the crofter's trust by smashing the window, stealing the money, and then hanging the leather pouch back before leaving. 

## 7. What made the peddler think that he had indeed fallen into a rattrap? 
Realizing he couldn't walk on the highway with stolen money, the peddler went into the woods. As he wandered endlessly, he understood he had fallen into the rattrap, fooled by the bait and now caught in it.

## 8. Why did the ironmaster speak kindly to the peddler and invite him home? 
The ironmaster, in the dim light of the furnace, mistook the peddler for his old regimental comrade, Captain von Stahle. Addressing him as Nils Olof, he kindly invited the stranger to his home.

## 9. Why did the peddler decline the invitation? 
The peddler knew the ironmaster had mistaken him for his old regimental comrade and feared being caught with the stolen thirty kronor. Realizing it would be like entering the lion's den, he declined the invitation.

## 10. What made the peddler accept Edla Willmansson's invitation? 
Miss Edla Willmansson noticed the peddler's fear and compassionately assured him he could leave freely. Her kind manner convinced him to accept her invitation to stay over Christmas Eve.

## 11. What doubts did Edla have about the peddler? 
When Edla lifted the peddler's hat, he jumped up in fright. Despite her kind expression and explanation of her visit, he remained anxious. His fear led her to suspect he was either a thief or an escaped prisoner.

## 12. When did the ironmaster realize his mistake? 
The next morning, the stranger was clean and well-dressed. The valet had bathed him, cut his hair, and shaved him. He was led to the dining room for breakfast, where the ironmaster saw him clearly in daylight. Realizing his mistake, the ironmaster threatened to call the Sheriff.

## 13. How did the peddler define himself against not having revealed his true identity? 
The peddler clarified he had never pretended to be someone else and had only sought shelter as a poor trader. He assured them he had caused no harm and offered to put on his old clothes and leave peacefully.

## 14. Why did Edla still entertain the peddler even after she knew the truth about him? 
Edla felt it would be wrong to send away someone they had invited and promised Christmas cheer. Despite learning the truth about the peddler, she decided to continue hosting him, wanting him to enjoy a day of peace with them.

## 15. Why was Edla happy to see the gift left by the peddler? 
Inside the gift package, Edla found a small rattrap with three wrinkled ten kronor notes and a letter addressed to her. The peddler, appreciative of her kindness, wanted to prevent her from facing embarrassment by returning what he had taken.

## 16. Why did the peddler sign himself as Captain von Stahle? 
Mistaken for Captain von Stahle, the peddler was warmly welcomed and treated with respect by the ironmaster, giving him a chance to redeem himself through honorable behavior.

## 17. How does the peddler interpret the acts of kindness and hospitality shown by the crofter, the ironmaster and his daughter? 
The peddler deceives the crofter by taking advantage of his loneliness for company. He aims to gain money from the ironmaster but is struck by the contrasting behaviors of the father and daughter. He is moved by Edla's kindness, care, and intervention on his behalf.

## 18. What are the instances in the story that show that the character of the ironmaster is different from that of his daughter? 
The ironmaster acts impulsively, mistaking the stranger for his old comrade in uncertain light and welcoming him warmly. However, upon seeing him clearly, he accuses him of dishonesty and threatens to involve the Sheriff.  
In contrast, his daughter is observant and suspects the stranger might be a thief or escaped prisoner. Despite this, she remains gentle, kind, and friendly towards him, continuing to treat him with care even after the mistaken identity is revealed. 

## 19. What made the peddler finally change his ways? 
Edla Willmansson treated the peddler kindly, interceding for him and continuing to host him despite learning the truth. Her compassion and generosity eventually inspired the peddler to change for the better.

## 20. How does the metaphor of the rattrap serve to highlight the human predicament? 
The world tempts people with riches, joy, shelter, and basic needs like baits in a rattrap. The peddler fell for the crofter's thirty kronor, hiding in fear and avoiding the Manor House. His peace returned only after he returned the money, escaping the trap of temptation.

## 21. The peddler comes out as a person with a subtle sense of humor. How does this serve to lighten the seriousness of the theme of the store and also endear him to us? 
The peddler shows a subtle sense of humor with the ironmaster and his daughter after they learn the truth about him. Unconcerned about the consequences, he amuses the ironmaster with his rattrap metaphor and sends a humorous letter with a Christmas present to Edla. This lightens the story's tone and makes him endearing to the reader.
