# The Last Lesson 

### 1. "What a thunderclap these words were to me!" Which were the words that shocked and surprised the narrator?

When M. Hamel announced to the class that it would be his last lesson because of language imposition orders from Berlin in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. After hearing this, Franz was shocked that his language was being taken away before he even knew how to write it. Therefore, those words were like a thunderclap to him. 

### 2. What was Franz expected to be prepared with for school that day? 

Franz was expected to be prepared with his lessons in French participles for school that day.

### 3. What had been put up on the bulletin board?

Ever since the war started, all the news about it including lost battles, drafts and orders from the commanding officer were put up on the bulletin board.

### 4. What changes did the order from Berlin cause in school that day? 

Franz arrived at school to find an unusual quietness akin to a Sunday morning. Inside, he noticed a departure from the usual strictness of M. Hamel, who greeted him kindly. The teacher was adorned in his finest attire, including a green coat, frilled shirt, and black silk cap reserved for special occasions. The back benches were filled with villagers, adding to the unusual atmosphere. 

### 5. How did Franz's feelings about M. Hamel and school change? 

Franz learned that it was the last lesson from his teacher and from the following day, only German would be taught. He felt sorry for not learning his lessons early and his books that appeared trouble and burden at the initial stage were now his good old friends. 

### 6. Franz thinks, “Will they make them sing in German, even the pigeons?” What could this mean?

Franz wondered if the Prussians had the authority to change not just the French language, but even the natural order, symbolized by the pigeons' cooing in German, which seemed unthinkable given their upbringing in French.

### 7. What did M. Hamel tell them about the French language? What did he ask them to do and why? 

M. Hamel passionately asserted to his students that French reigned supreme as the world's most exquisite language, renowned for its clarity and logical coherence. He earnestly urged them to preserve its essence within their collective consciousness, imploring them never to forsake its importance and beauty.

### 8. Who did M. Hamel blame for the neglect of learning on the part of boys like Franz? 

M. Hamel held parents accountable for the educational neglect observed in boys like Franz, as they prioritized earning a livelihood over academic endeavors. Additionally, he accepted blame for his teaching oversights, recognizing his own role in failing to adequately educate and motivate his students.

### 9. "It was all much more tempting than the rule of participles...", What did Franz find much more tempting? How did he finally react? 

Franz found the warm, bright weather and the outdoor scenes, such as birds chirping and Prussian soldiers drilling, much more tempting than studying participles. However, despite the temptation, he ultimately resisted and hurried off to school.

### 10. How did M. Hamel behave as the last lesson came to an end? 

M. Hamel rose from his chair, looking pale and serious. He attempted to speak but was too overwhelmed with emotion. Instead, he wrote "Vive La France!" on the blackboard with chalk. Then, he paused, leaning against the wall. Without a word, he gestured for the students to leave, indicating that the class was dismissed.

### 11. Why did M. Hamel say that they all had a great deal to reproach themselves with? 

M. Hamel conveyed that the responsibility for not learning their native language fell on everyone. He acknowledged his own fault, admitting that he sometimes prioritized leisure activities like fishing over teaching, or sent students away for their own errands instead of instructing them.

### 12. How far had Franz progressed in French?  What factors were responsible for this? 

Overall, Franz had very poor performance in his French lessons which was evident by his hesitation to go to school and fear of being scolded by his teacher. Later that day when the teacher asked him about French participles he got it all mixed up and wasn't able to answer.  
The reasons for his poor performance were his distractions of playing outside and his parents opting for quick monetary gain instead of his studying. His teacher also blamed himself for giving holidays when he went out fishing and not focusing on him well enough previously.
