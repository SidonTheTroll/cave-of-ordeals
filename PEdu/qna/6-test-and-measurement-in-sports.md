### 1. Mention the items of Johnson-Metheny test. 
This test battery is revised version of Johnson's Educability test which was designed in 1942 by Johnson to measure neuromuscular capacity. The original Johnson battery test consisted of 10 motor stunts performed down length of a 5/10 feet gymnasium mat specifically marked for the educability test. In 1938 Metheny only introduced 4 stunts cordated highly with the total Johnson score. By eliminating the 6 motor stunts, Metheny modified the mat area. The test battery consists of 4 battery stunts. 

1. Front roll for boys and girls. 
2. Back roll for boys and girls. 
3. Jumping half turn for boys and girls. 
4. Jumping full turn for only boys. 

The stunt will be performed in a test area, i.e., 15 ft long and 2 ft wide is marked as shown that the 15 ft length is divided into 10 sections of 18 inches. The width of the transverse line is 3/4 inch and 3 alternatively. The center of the lines remains 18 inches apart. In the center of the mat area, another 3/4 inch wide line is drawn lengthwise.
