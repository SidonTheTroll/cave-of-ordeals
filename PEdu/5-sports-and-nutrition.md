## Q/ What is a Balanced Diet? 
A diet that contains the proper amount of each nutrients like carbohydrates, fast, protein, etc. according to the needs of individuals is called a balanced diet. 

## Q/ What is nutrition? 
It is a process of obtaining and consuming food or breaking down food an substances taken in by the mouth to use for energy in the body. 

--- 

- **Nutrients**: The energic food in our diet that consists of various types of essential chemicals for our body are termed nutrients. Such as fats, proteins, vitamins, etc. 
    - **Macronutrients**: needed in large amounts (water, fats, carbohydrates)
    - **Micronutrients**: needed in small amounts (vitamins and minerals)

- **Vitamins**: organic molecules that are essential in small amounts for proper metabolic function. 
    - **Water-insoluble**: A, D, E, K 
    - **Water-soluble**: B, C 

- **Nutritive components**: energy is provided 
- **Non-nutritive components**: no energy is provided  

> [!NOTE]
> 1 g carbohydrate = 4 calories 

- **Saturated fats**: solid fats that come from dairy and animal products. They contain bad cholesterol. 
- **Unsaturated fats**: liquid at room temperature fats that come from vegetables and fruits. They contain good cholesterol. 

## Q/ Enlist the non-nutritive compounds of diet. Explain about any two components of diet. 
Non-nutritive components:  
1. Fiber and roughage 
2. Water 
3. Color compounds 
4. Flavor compounds 
5. Plant compounds 

And the two components of diet are: 

1. **Carbohydrates**: Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. When consumed, carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which is used by the body's cells for energy. If the energy provided by carbohydrates is not used, the excess is converted into fat and stored in the body's fatty tissues. There are three main types of carbohydrates:
    1. **Sugars**: These are simple carbohydrates, also known as simple sugars. They include glucose, fructose, and galactose (monosaccharides), as well as sucrose, lactose, and maltose (disaccharides). Sources include fruits, honey, table sugar, and dairy products.
    2. **Starches**: These are complex carbohydrates made up of many glucose units linked together. They are found in foods such as potatoes, rice, bread, and pasta. Starches are broken down into glucose during digestion.
    3. **Fiber**: This is also a complex carbohydrate, but it is not digestible by the human body. Fiber aids in digestion and helps to maintain a healthy digestive system. It is found in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes.
2. **Fats**: Fats are an essential nutritive component that helps the body store energy and maintain body temperature. They also cushion and protect vital organs by forming soft tissues. There are two main types of fats: good fats and bad fats. **Good fats**, which are beneficial for heart health, include unsaturated fats such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Sources of good fats include avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish like salmon and mackerel. **Bad fats**, which can increase the risk of heart disease, include saturated fats and trans fats. Saturated fats are found in animal products like red meat, butter, and cheese, while trans fats are often found in processed and fried foods, as well as margarine and baked goods. Balancing the intake of good fats while minimizing bad fats is crucial for maintaining overall health.

## What type of nutrition would you take before, during and after taking part in competition? Explain in brief. 
**Before competition**, an athlete should consume carbohydrates to enhance glycogen stores, providing a steady supply of energy. Carbohydrates are essential as they break down into glucose, which fuels muscle activity. Ideal foods include bread, fruits, rice, and potatoes, consumed about two hours before the competition. This timing allows for optimal digestion and absorption, ensuring sufficient energy without causing sluggishness or gastrointestinal discomfort. It's important to avoid excessive carb intake, as it can lead to feelings of lethargy and impact performance.

**During competition**, maintaining hydration and stable blood sugar levels is crucial. Hydration helps regulate body temperature and prevent dehydration, which can impair physical and cognitive performance. The required fluid intake varies depending on the climate and individual sweat rates. Light, easily digestible foods that provide sustained energy are beneficial, such as bananas, which offer potassium and carbohydrates; chocolate, which provides quick energy; and glucose drinks, which help maintain blood sugar levels. These foods help sustain energy levels without causing a sudden spike or drop, ensuring consistent performance.

**After competition**, replenishing energy stores and aiding recovery is vital for muscle repair and glycogen restoration. The first priority is rehydration with water or electrolyte drinks to replace fluids lost through sweat. Light foods should be consumed immediately post-competition to kickstart recovery. Within 1-2 hours, athletes should have a high-carbohydrate or substantial meal to restore glycogen levels and support muscle recovery. This meal can include a balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats, with options like cheese, milk, eggs, lean meats, potatoes, rice, and fish. Protein aids in muscle repair, while carbohydrates replenish glycogen stores. Including nutrient-dense foods ensures comprehensive recovery, preparing the athlete for future training or competition.
