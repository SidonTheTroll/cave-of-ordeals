# Children and Women in Sports 
Most aches and pains faced by adults aren't result of injuries, but the result of long time effects of distortions in posture or alignment that have their origins in childhood or adolescence, result of improper posture or overuse of television, computers, mobile phones, fast/junk food and lack of regular physical activities. Due to these reasons, childhood obesity has increased extraordinarily during past decades. 

# Exercise Guidelines of Who for Different Age Groups 
Exercise or physical activities have potential to improve physical and mental health of the nation, reduce maximum causes of mortality and improve life expectancy. These help in preventing and managing non-communicable diseases such as heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, several types of cancer, hypertension, maintaining, healthy body weight and improving quality of life. 

Physical activity is defined as any voluntarily body movement produced by contraction of skeletal muscles that require energy expenditure. Walking, climbing stairs, gardening, playing any game, dancing, running, swimming and yoga are considered best examples of physical activity. According to **Department of Health and Human Services**, *Physical activity generally refers to any movement that health.* 

At global level, it is estimated that one in four adults and 81% of adolescents do not have enough physical activity. Increased levels of physical inactivity have negative impacts on health systems, environment, economic development, community well-being and quality of life.

# World Health Organization Guidelines on Physical Activity/Exercise 
The WHO issued guidelines for physical activity in the year 2010, which were updated and replaced in 2020. It provided details for different age groups on how much physical activity/exercise is required for good health. Thee guidelines are mentioned below: 

## 1. For children under 5 years of age

# Common Postural Deformities 
These are the deformities that are related to the spine. These are generally caused by carrying excessive weight beyond one's capacity. Weak muscles can also cause spinal curvature. **The normal lumbar spine is characterized by a moderate anterior hyperextension curve, when viewed laterally.** There are three types of spinal deformities:

1. Kyphosis 
2. Lordosis 
3. Scoliosis 

## Kyphosis 
It is an increase or exaggeration of a backward or posterior curve or a decrease or reversal of a forward curve. It is also called round upper back. Depression of chest is common in kyphosis. 

- **Cause**: malnutrition, illness, crowded areas, unavailability of pure air, insufficient exercise, rickets, carrying heavy loads on shoulders, unsuitable furniture, weak muscles, habit of working by leaning forward.
- **Precautions**: from the very beginning, work in an appropriate posture while sitting, standing and walking. Proper and adequate exercise iss helpful and avoid everything that's mentioned in the causes. 
- **Remedies** 
    1. Sit in chair so that the hips touch the back of the chair. While looking upward, hold your hands behind the back in such a way that your shoulders may remain stretched backward. Remain in this position for some time. 
    2. Keep a pillow under the back while sleeping.
    3. Bend your head backward while in standing position. 
    4. Perform dhanurasana regularly. 

## Lordosis 
It is the inward curvature of spine. It is an in creased forward curve in lumbar region. It creates problem while standing and walking as the body seems to be stiff. 

- **Causes**: imbalanced diet, improper environment, improper development of muscles, obesity, diseases affecting vertebra and spinal muscles, not performing exercise. 
- **Precautions**: balance diet, obesity should also be avoided, body should be straight while carrying weight, and excessive intake of food should be avoided. 
- **Remedies**:
    1. While maintaining a standing position, bend forward from hip level; repeat the exercise 10 times. 
    2. Lie down in bed and raise your head and legs simultaneously for 10 times. 
    3. Perporm sit-ups regularly. 
    4. Halasana should be performed regularly. 

## Scoliosis 
Postural deformation of spine in lateral direction (sideways) is called scoliosis and the curve is called scoliotic curve. It is categorized by the curve as left or right convexity. A simple curve to the left, i.e., convexity left is commonly called 'C' curve. But in some cases, it can also be 'S' curve.

- **Causes**: diseases in joints of bones, underdeveloped legs, infantile paralysis, rickets, carrying heavy loads on one shoulder, unhealthy conditions, partial deafness and wrong standing posture. It can also be congenital or acquired abnormality of vertebra, muscles and nerves. 
- **Precautions**: balance diet, avoid studying in sideway bending posture and walking long time while carrying load on one hand. 
- **Remedies**:
    1. Bending exercise opposite to the 'C' curve.
    2. Hold horizontal bar and swing the body sideways or hang for some time.
    3. Swim using breaststroke technique.

## Flatfoot 
It is a condition where the arch of the feet is flattened, causing the entire sole to touch the ground while standing. It is present at birth and goes away but can develop later in life due to aging, injury and/or straining. This condition leads to discomfort, pain and difficulty in movement. 

- **Causes**: weak muscles, rapid increase of body weight and improper shoes. 
- **Precautions**: shoes should be proper shape and size, obesity and high heels should be avoided, and don't force or encourage babies to walk at an early stage. 
- **Remedies**:
    1. Walking on heels and toes.
    2. Walking on inner and outer side of feet. 
    3. Perform vajrasana. 
    4. Skipping on rope. 

## Knock-knees 
In this deformity, both the knees touch each other while standing as the gap of the ankles increase. Individuals face difficulty in walking and running. Due to this deformity, people cannot beccome good sportsperson and join defence services. 

- **Causes**: lack of balance diet, especially vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus and chronic illness like obesity, flatfoot and carrying weights at early age. 
- **Precautins**: balanced diet should be taken and babies shouldn't be encouraged or forced to walk at early age. 
- **Remedies**:
    1. Horse riding
    2. Perform padmasana and gomukhasana regularly 
    3. Cod liver oil is deneficial in reducing the deformity.
    4. Walking callipers can help in movement. 

## Bow Legs 
It is a postural deformity where there's a wide gap between the legs while standing with feet together. It is also called ***genu varum***. This deformity can be observed easily when the individual walks or runs. 

- **Causes**: deficiency of calcium and phosphorus in bones and vitamin D which softens long bones and also by improper walking or forcing babies to walk at very early age. 
- **Precautions**: don't let children be overweight and encourage babies to walk at early stage and there's shouldn't be deficiency of vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus in diet. 
- **Remedies**:
    1. Intake adequate vitamin D 
    2. Balanced diet should be taken
    3. Walking on inner edge of the feet. 

## Round Shoulders 
It is a postural deformity when the shoulders bend inward and the back seems bent forward. 

- **Causes**: can be hereditary, wearing very tight clothes, sitting on improper furniture and lacking proper exercise. 
- **Precautions**: don't sit walk or stand in bent position, sit on uncomfortable furniture and avoid tight-fitting clothes 
- **Remedies**:
    1. Keep fingertips on the shoulders and rotate the elbows clockwise or anticlockwise.
    2. Hold horizontal bar for some time. 
    3. Perform chakrasana and dhanurasana regularly.
