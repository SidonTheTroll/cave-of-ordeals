# Section A 
1. A compound Z with molecular formula reacts with $C_3H_9N$ reacts with $C_6H_5SO_2Cl$ to give a solid, insoluble in alkali. Identify Z. 
2. Why butan-1-ol is optically inactive and butan-2-ol is optically active? 
3. Convert nitrobenzene in benzoic acid.
4. A primary amine, $RNH_2$ can be treated with $CH_3-X$ to get secondary amine, $R-NHCH_3$ but the only disadvantage if that $3\degree$ amine and quaternary ammonium salts are also obtained as side products. Can you suggest a method where $RNH_2$ form only $2\degree$ amine? 
5. Write the structures and names of the compounds formed when compound 'A' with molecular formula $C_7H_8$ is treated with $Cl_2$ in the presence of $FeCl_3$

# Section B 
6. 1. Allyl chloride is hydrolyzed more readily than n-proply chloride.
    2. The treatment of alkyl chloride with Aq. $KOH$ leads to the formation of alcohol but in the presence of alcoholic $KOH$ alkenes are the major product.
7. Explain anomers and Zwitter ion.
8. A colorless substance 'A' $(C_6H_7N)$ is sparingly soluble in water and gives a water-soluble compound 'B' on treatment with mineral acid. On reacting with $CHCl_3$ and alcoholic potash, 'A' produces an obnoxious smell due to compound 'C' formation. The reaction of 'A' with benzene sulphonyl chloride gives compound 'D', which is soluble in alkali. With $NaNO_2$ with $HCl$, 'A' forms compound 'E', which reacts with phenol in an alkaline medium to give 'F' orange dye. Identify compounds 'A' to 'F'. 
9. Why haloarene undergo electrophilic substitution and haloalkanes as nucleophilic substitution. 
10. 1. Convert methly bromide to acetone. 
    2. Give chemical test between chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. 

# Section C 
11. 1. Compound 'A' with molecular formula $C_4H_9Br$ is treated with an aq $KOH$ solution. The rate of this reaction depends upon the concentration of the compound A only when another optically active isomer B of this compound was treated with aqueous $KOH$ solution the rate of reaction was found to be dependent on concentration of compound and KOH both
        1.  Write down the structural formula of both compound 'A' and 'B'. 
        2.  Out of these two compounds, which one will be converted to the product with inverted configuration. 
    2. An optically active compound having molecular formula $C_7H_15Br$ react with aq $KOH$ to give a racemic mixture of product write the mechanism involved in this reaction. 
    3. Why d and l form of racemic mixture is difficult to separate? 
12. 1. Explain what is meant by the following: 
        1.  Peptide linkage 
        2.  Pyranose structure of glusose
    2. Explain amphoteric nature of amino acid. 
    3. Diazonium salts of aromatic amines are more stable than aliphatic amines. 
    4. Gabriel synthesis is preferred for primary amines only.
