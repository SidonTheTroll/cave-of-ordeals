# Electric Charges and Fields 

# Electric Charges 

- Characteristics
    1. Intrinsic Property (internal property)
    2. Gives rise to electrical force between various objects. 

- $e = 1.6\times10^{-19} \text{ Columb}\ (C)$

- **Electrostatics**: study of charges at rest.
    - Charge types: +ve, -ve

# Conductors, Insulators and Di-electrics 

> [!NOTE]
> All insulators are dielectrics and don't conduct electricity. However, when electric field is applied, induced charges appears on them.

# Basic Property of Electrical Charge

1. **Additivity**: charges can be added, notice charge sign, negative charges repel.
2. **Quantization**: specific value of charges
3. **Conservation**: net charge is conserved if system is isolated 

## Additivity of Charge 
Property of virtue by which the total charge of a system is obtained simply by adding algebrially all the charges present in the system.

$q=q_1+q_2+q_3....$

> [!NOTE]
> Proper sign convention should be used while adding charges.

> [!CAUTION] Find net charge of a system containing 4 charges 
> $2\mu C, -3\mu C, 4\mu C, -5 \mu C$  
> 
> $q = {2+(-3)+4+(-5)}\mu C$  
> $\implies -2\mu C$

## Quantization of Charge 
The property by virtue by which the charge on a body is integral multiple of basic unit of charge (i.e., electron and proton) represented as '$e$'.

$q = ne$ [n = 1, 2, 3....; $e = 1.6\times 10^{-19}C$]

> [!NOTE]
> Only integral charges can be transferred. 

# Conservation of Charges 
1. Total charge in an isolated system remains constant. 
2. The electric charge can neither be created nor destroyed, they can only be transferred from one body to another.
