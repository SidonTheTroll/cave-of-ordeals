# Electric Charges and Fields 

# Electric Charges 

- Characteristics
    1. Intrinsic Property (internal property)
    2. Gives rise to electrical force between various objects. 

- $e = 1.6\times10^{-19} \text{ Columb}\ (C)$

- **Electrostatics**: study of charges at rest.
    - Charge types: +ve, -ve

# Conductors, Insulators and Di-electrics 

> [!NOTE]
> All insulators are dielectrics and don't conduct electricity. However, when electric field is applied, induced charges appears on them.

# Basic Property of Electrical Charge

1. **Additivity**: charges can be added, notice charge sign, negative charges repel.
2. **Quantization**: specific value of charge
3. **Conservation**: net charge is conserved if system is isolated
