# Vectors 

# Modulus of a Vector 

It is given by, 

$\overrightarrow{A}=Ax\hat{i}+Ay\hat{j}+Az\hat{k}$  
$|\overrightarrow{A}|=A=\sqrt{Ax^2+Ay^2+Az^2}$

# Unit Vector

$\hat{A}=\frac{\overrightarrow{A}}{|\overrightarrow{A}|}=\frac{\overrightarrow{A}}{A}$ 

# Resultant of a Vector 

$R=\sqrt{A^2+B^2+2AB\cos\theta}$

# Directions of Resultant 

$\tan\beta=\frac{B\sin\theta}{A+B\cos\theta}$

> [!NOTE]
> If asked to find resultant, either find it in vector form or find both magnitude or direction separately. 

# Position Vector 

$\overrightarrow{r_1}+\overrightarrow{r_{12}}=\overrightarrow{r_2}$  
$\overrightarrow{r_{12}}=\overrightarrow{r_2}-\overrightarrow{r_1}$

$\overrightarrow{r_{12}}$ = position vector of 1 with respect to 2. 

> [!NOTE]
> Vector quantity has both magnitude and direction and follows **triangular or parallelogram law of vector addition**.
>   1. While calculating any vector quantity, components must be taken carefully.
>   2. Learn to differentiate between vector and scalar quantity.
