# Cave of Ordeals - Code of Conduct
This repository is dedicated to sharing, discussing, and improving school notes to help in study and archiving academic content.. To ensure that this space remains constructive and respectful, I’ve established the following guidelines.

## 1. **Respectful and Inclusive Behavior**
- Treat everyone with kindness and respect.
- Any form of harassment, or abusive language will not be tolerated although some specific people are excluded from interacting with the repository.
- Acknowledge that people may have different opinions and learning styles. Be open to constructive feedback.

## 2. **Academic Integrity**
- This is an archival repository, so keep in mind that everything here is for study and storage only.
- Do **NOT** upload or share content that violates the school’s academic integrity policies. This includes sharing:
  - **Personal information of School Staff Members**
  - **Stolen Data from other Students**
- Always give credit where it is due only in the case of Indivials. No applied if diagrams are taken from online sources, we got reverse search for that reason. 

## 3. **Content Guidelines**
- Ensure that your notes are accurate and helpful. Misleading or incorrect information should be corrected promptly.
- Notes should be organized and easy to navigate for everyone. Use clear titles, descriptions, and structure.
- Avoid uploading excessively large files. Use PDFs, markdown files, or other space-efficient formats when possible.
  - Above rule doesn't apply for mutable formats for documents and images.
