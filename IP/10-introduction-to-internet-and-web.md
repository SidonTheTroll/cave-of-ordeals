### 1. What is WWW? How does it function? 
The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the internet. It allows users to view and navigate web pages using web browsers.

Below are its functioning: 

1. **Web Pages**: Information is stored in web pages written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which can contain text, images, videos, and links to other pages.
2. **Web Browsers**: Users use browsers to request these pages by entering URLs (web addresses).
3. **Web Servers**: The request is sent to a web server, which hosts the web pages. The server retrieves the requested page and sends it back to the user's browser.
4. **HTTP/HTTPS**: Data is transmitted between the browser and server using protocols like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (secure version).

### 2. What is a server? What is web server? 
A **server** is a computer that provides data or services to other computers (clients) over a network.

A **web server** stores and delivers web pages to users via the internet when they request a website, using protocols like HTTP/HTTPS.

### 3. Enlist some services provided by a web server. 
Some services provided by a web server include:

1. **Hosting websites** – Storing and delivering web pages to users.
2. **File storage** – Storing and sharing files via the web.
3. **Content delivery** – Serving static (HTML, CSS, images) and dynamic content (via server-side scripts).
4. **Data encryption** – Ensuring secure communication through HTTPS.
5. **Load balancing** – Distributing traffic across multiple servers.

### 9. Briefly explain the basic concept of a web server and web hosting. 
A **web server** is a computer system that stores and delivers web pages to users over the internet, responding to browser requests via protocols like HTTP or HTTPS.

**Web hosting** is a service that provides storage space and resources on a server, allowing individuals or businesses to make their websites accessible online. Hosting companies offer server space and management for websites to be viewed on the internet.

### 10. The first page on a website that allows you to navigate to other page via menu system or links, is known as- (a) front page (b) primary page (c) home page (d) first page (e) main page
Home page. 

### 11. What is a web site? How is it related to a web page and a home page? 
A **website** is a collection of related web pages that are hosted on a server and accessible via the internet, typically identified by a common domain name.

- A **web page** is a single document within a website, usually formatted in HTML, containing specific content.
- A **homepage** is the main or introductory page of a website, serving as the starting point for navigation to other pages. 

### 12. What do you understand by a (a) Web browser (b) Web server ?
1. **Web Browser**: A web browser is a software application that enables users to access, retrieve, and view content on the internet, such as web pages, images, and videos. Popular examples include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.

2. **Web Server**: A web server is a computer system that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to users upon request. It uses protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with web browsers and provide the requested content.

### 13. What is an URL? What are its components? Exemplify. 
An **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access a specific resource on the internet. It specifies the location of a resource and the protocol used to retrieve it.

**Components of an URL**:

1. **Protocol**: Indicates the method used to access the resource (e.g., `http://` or `https://`).
2. **Domain Name**: The address of the server hosting the resource (e.g., `www.example.com`).
3. **Path**: The specific location of the resource on the server (e.g., `/page1`).
4. **Query String**: (Optional) Additional parameters for the resource (e.g., `?id=123`).
5. **Fragment**: (Optional) A specific section of the resource (e.g., `#section1`).

**Example**:  
`https://www.example.com/page1?id=123#section1`  
- Protocol: `https`
- Domain Name: `www.example.com`
- Path: `/page1`
- Query String: `?id=123`
- Fragment: `#section1`

### 14. How is an absolute URL different from a relative URL? 
An **absolute URL** provides the complete address of a resource, including the protocol, domain name, and path. For example, `https://www.example.com/images/photo.jpg` is an absolute URL.

A **relative URL** specifies a resource's location relative to the current page's URL, omitting the domain and protocol. For example, `images/photo.jpg` is a relative URL that points to a resource in the same domain and directory as the current page. 

### 15. What do you understand by http? How is it related to the world wide web? 
**HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transferring data over the internet, enabling communication between web browsers and servers.

It is essential to the **World Wide Web** because it allows users to request and receive web pages and resources. Without HTTP, the web would not function.

### 16. What are the two parts of an email address? Which character is used to separate these two parts? 
An email address consists of two parts: the **local part** (username) and the **domain part**. The character used to separate these two parts is the **at symbol (@)**. 

For example, in the email address **username@example.com**, "username" is the local part, and "example.com" is the domain part where '@' symbol is the separator. 

### 17. Explain the structure of an email address. 
The structure of an email address consists of two main parts, separated by the **at symbol (@)**:

1. **Local Part**: This is the username or identifier for the specific user or mailbox. It can include letters, numbers, and special characters (e.g., `john.doe` or `info123`).

2. **Domain Part**: This indicates the mail server that hosts the email account. It usually consists of two parts:
   - **Domain Name**: The main part of the address (e.g., `example`).
   - **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**: The suffix indicating the type of organization or location (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.net`).

For example, in the email address **john.doe@example.com**:
- Local Part: `john.doe`
- Domain Part: `example.com`

### 18. Explain the structure of an email message. Also differentiate between *cc:* and *bcc:* fields. 
An email message typically consists of the following components:

1. **Header**: Contains metadata about the email, including:
   - **To**: The recipient's email address.
   - **From**: The sender's email address.
   - **Subject**: A brief description of the email's content.
