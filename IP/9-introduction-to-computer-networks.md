# Introduction to Computer Networks

> [!NOTE]
> Q/ Why connect computers?  
> Connecting computers is important as it allows for sharing of information and it saves time as compared to a physical medium.

# Types of Connection 
## On the Basis of Connection 
- Advantages of Wired Connection
    1. Data is secure
    2. Low latency 
    3. Indefinite distance with strong connection 
- Advantages of Wireless Connection 
    1. Can support different devices at the same time 
    2. No requirement of wires 
    3. Devices can be shifted but connection is preserved

## On the Basis of Quantity 
1. **LAN**: Local Area Network 
2. **MAM**: Metropolitan Area Network 
3. **CAN**: Campus Area Network
4. **WAN**: Wide Area Network 
5. **PAN**: Personal Area Network 

# On the Basis of Topology (Design)
1. Point-to-Point 
2. Star
3. Bus 
4. Ring 
5. Tree 
6. Mesh 
7. Fully Connected 

# QnA 
### 1. What is Network? What are the goals and applications? 
A computer network is a connection of interconnected autonomous computing devices so as exchange information or share resources.  
Computer networks are useful in many ways. They facilitate resources sharing such as storage, software, etc. on the network can be shared, enhanced communication, cost reduction and so fourth.  
There are lots of uses and applications of networks such as share resources like sharing software, sharing storage, etc., it helps us to improve the communications. 

### 2. Discuss and compare various types of networks. 
A computer network means a group of networked computers, i.e., computers that are linked by means of a communication system. A network can mean a small group of linked computers to a chain of few hundred computers of different types spread around the world. Thus, network vary in size, complexity and geographical spread.  
On the basis of size, we can categorize network in the some groups, such as, 
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: It covers a small area with limited number of computers. 
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Covers a small city or big city with multiple number of computer. 
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: It is a short term network and created by individual to share data from one device from one device to other. Normally two devices are used in the type of network. 
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: It has no geographical boundaries. It allows connecting computers from all over the world. Another common name of this network is INTERNET.

On the basis of connection, we can categorize network in two groups, such as, 
- Wired network 
- Wireless network

### 3. Explain various mostly used topologies. 
The pattern of interconnection of nodes in a network is called topology. Many topologies have been developed but major ones are: 
1. **Star**: This topology consists of a central node which all other nodes are connected by a single path. 
2. **Bus**: Another popular topology for data networks is the bus topology or linear topology. This consists of a single length of the transmission medium onto which the various nodes are attached. The topology is used in traditional data communication network where the host at one end of the bus communicates with several terminals attached along its length. 
3. **Ring**: In ring topology, each node is connected with only two neighboring nodes where data is accepted from one of the neighboring node and is transmitted onward to another. 
4. **Tree**: The shape of this network is that of an inverted tree with the central root branching and sub-branching to the extremes of the network. Transmission in this topology takes place in same way as in the bus topology. 
5. **Mesh**: In this topology each node is connected to more than one node to provide an alternative route in the case the host is either down or too busy. It is an extension to P-P network. 
6. **Fully-Connected**: When in a network, each host is connected to other directly. If there is a direct link between each host, then the network is said to be fully connected. 

### 4. Discuss the factors that govern the selection of a topology of a network. 
There are a number of factors to consider while deciding to select a proper topology. The most important of which are set out below: 
- **Cost**: For a network to be cost effective, one would try to minimize installation cost. 
- **Flexibility**: Because the arrangement of furniture, internal walls, etc. in offices is often subject to change, the topology should allow for easy reconfiguration of network. 
- **Reliability**: Failure in a network can take two forms. Firstly, an individual node can malfunction. This is not nearly as serious as the second type of fault where the network itself fails to operate. 

### 5. Which of the following is not a network topology: Star, mesh, tree, bug, bus. 
Bug 

### 6. Compare and contrast 
1. Star and bus topology. 

| Star Topology | Bus Topology | 
|:-:|:-:|
| This topology consists of a central node to which all other nodes are connected by a single path. | This topology consists of single length of the transmission medium onto which the various nodes are attached. 
| The addition of a new node to a star network involves a connection all the way to the central node which is expensive. | Addition nodes can be connected at any point along in its length. | 

2. Star and tree 

| Star Topology | Tree Topology | 
|:-:|:-:|
| This topology consists of a central node to which all other nodes are connected by a single path. | Transmission in this topology takes place in the same way as in the bus topology. | 
| Star topology is one of the easiest topology design. | Tree topology is more difficult to configure and wire than other topology. |
