# Introduction 
With the integration of technology into our life, it has made it much easier and raised some problems at the same time.

This chapter deals with the specific issues and problems related to society, ethics and law. 

# Digital Footprint 
It is a trail of data created as a result of our online activity including the websites we visited, social media posts interacted with and items bought. 

- Types 
    1. **Active Digital Footprint**: data that is intentionally submitted on the internet. 
        - Eg: sending emails, and messages, posting on social media, replying to a message, etc. 
    2. **Passive Digital Footprint**: data trail that is unintentionally left due to our online presence. 
        - Eg: visiting a website (IP tracking)

Digital footprint is almost permanent and cannot be erased because of the data sharing, small traces or untouched data remains in the servers. 

## Managing Digital Footprint 
1. **Know what your digital footprint is**: know what information about you online.
2. **E-behave responsibly**: be smart and sensible enough about the websites visited, emails sent and links opened. Make sure not to share the location online. 
3. **Keep digital footprint clean**: remove any trace that can be deemed inappropriate based on context and remove details that reveal too much information like phone number, school, college name, address etc. 
4. **Control the visibility of information**: every web browser and social media site allows control of the visibility and access of information. Rather than keeping everything public, make the necessary information private or be selective of who can access the information. 
5. **Allow comments moderation**: keep comments on social media moderated via automation or yourself to keep a positive digital footprint. 
6. **Think before posting**: be cautious about the content that you post online and if something feels wrong, it is also wrong to post. 

# Net and Communications Etiquettes 
**Netiquette** is derived from **"net"** (internet) and **"etiquette"** referring to online manners while using the internet and working online. 

1. **Refrain from personal abuse**: no verbal abuse against the person you disagree with. 
2. **Never spam**: don't repeatedly post the same advertisement of products or services. 
3. **Write clearly and concisely**: on a site with a lot of non-native English speakers, be formal and avoid slang that they don't understand. 
4. **Always post correct content in respectful language**: use proper language because it can be read by anyone online.
5. **In a discussion forum, stick to the topic**: don't post irrelevant content in the chatrooms that it is not supposed to be. 
6. **Don't expect others to do your homework for you**: everyone has their own life and just do your work yourself instead of complaining about it to others. 
7. **Don't post copyrighted material to which you don't own the rights**: it is plagiarism and if used, ask the owner for permission and enclose copyright information and cite its source. 

> [!NOTE]
> Failing to abide by the above can lead to legal trouble. 

## Email Etiquettes 
For business and personal use, formality in emails is required to convey the message efficiently. 

1. **Be concise and to the point**: don't make the email unnecessarily long because it discourages the reader from reading it. 
2. **Use proper spelling, grammar and punctuation**: the use of incorrect English gives a bad impression on the reader. 
3. **Use proper structure and layout**: since reading from a screen is different from reading from a paper, it's important to structure our messages properly to avoid confusion. 
4. **DO NOT WRITE IN UPPERCASE**: in some conditions, it is considered shouting and might trigger an unwanted response, do this only to highlight important information in messages. 
5. **Add an email disclaimer**: Disclaimers are required if dealing with data that has the potential to be malware to not be liable for any damages. 
6. **Hangle abbreviations and emoticons with care**: in business emails, the use of abbreviations and emojis/emoticons and generally inappropriate. 
7. **Gender sensitivity**: while writing to an unknown person, use gender-neutral pronouns because of cultural differences, they might get annoyed.

# Ethical Issues 
In this age, information is considered the intellectual property of a person or body and there are many ethical issues involved with the usage and availability of information. 

Some common ethical issues are: 
1. Intellectual property rights 
2. Digital property rights
3. Plagiarism

## Intellectual property rights 
Any piece of information that is created is an intellectual property and there is a cost factor that was involved in its production. Once created, it is easy to duplicate and this makes information difficult to safeguard, unlike actual property. 

The creator/producer of the information is the real owner of the information and they have every right to protect their property via. **Copyright** or **patent** or use of **trademarks**. 

- **Copyright**: it's a collection of rights automatically vested to someone who has created the original work and the owner has the right to keep or transfer the right to one or many people if necessary. 
- **Copyright infringement**: it is when someone uses copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright holder. 
- **Patent**: it grants the exclusive right to the owner by the government to prevent others from making, selling, using or importing a particular product or service, in exchange for full disclosure of their invention. 
- **Trademark**: it's a word, symbol, sound, color and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the product of one party from the other. 

To summarize, information shouldn't be exchanged without the consent of the owner.  
Intellectual property must be protected as it: 

- encourages individuals and businesses to create new software and applications, as well as improve existing ones. 
- ensures new ideas and technologies are widely distributed. 
- promotes investment in the national economy.
