# Aim of the Experiment 
To verify the law of series combination of resistances using a meter bridge. 

# Apparatus and Material Required 
1. Meter bridge 
2. Sensitive galvanometer 
3. 2 resistance wires 
4. Resistance box 
5. Jockey 
6. Plug key 
7. Battery eliminator 
8. Thick connecting wires 

# Theory 
1. **Measurement of unknown resistance**: with the known resistance R in the left gap and the unknown resistance S ($R_1$ or $R_2$ or series combination of $R_1$ and $R_2$) in the right gap of the meter bridge, suppose the balance point is obtained at a distance $l$ cm from the left end, then the unknown resistance is given by 

$$
S = R(\frac{100-l}{l})
$$

2. **Law of Series combination of resistances**: when two resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$ are connected in series, their equivalent resistance $R_S$ is given by: $R_S = R_1 + R_2$

# Calculations 
- Experimental value of series combination of resistances, $R_S$ = **8.66** $\Omega$
- Theoretical value of series combination of resistances, $R_S' = R_1 + R_2$ = **8.66** $\Omega$
- Difference = $R_S-R_S'$ = 0 $\Omega$

# Result 
Withing the limits of experimental error, the experimental and theoretical values of the series combination of resistances are equal. So the law of combination of series stands verified.
