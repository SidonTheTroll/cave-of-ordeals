## Aim of the Experiment 
To determine the resistance of a galvanometer by half deflection method and to find its figure of merit. 

## Apparatus and Material Required 
1. Weston type galvanometer 
2. Battery of 3 V/a battery eliminator
3. High resistance box (0-10 $k\Omega$)
4. Low resistance box (0-200 $\Omega$)
5. Two one-way keys
6. Voltmeter (0-3 V) 
7. Connecting wires 
8. Piece of sand paper 

## Working Formulae 
1. The resistance of G of a galvanometer by half deflection method is given by 
$$
G = \frac{RS}{R-S}
$$
where R is the resistance in series with the galvanometer and S is the shunt resistance. 
2. The figure of merit of the galvanometer is given by 
$$
k = \frac{\mathcal{E}}{(R+G)\theta}
$$
where $\theta$ is the deflection produced with series resistance R and $\mathcal{E}$ is the emf of the battery. 

## Circuit Diagrams 

## Procedure 
### [A] Resistance of the galvanometer by half deflection method 
1. Draw a neat circuit diagram as given in the figure and arrange the required apparatus on the working table accordingly. 
2. Clean the ends of the connecting wires with a sand paper. Connect the battery $\mathcal{E}$, galvanometer G, high resistance box R and key $K_1$ in series. Connect a low resistance box S and key $K_2$ in parallel with the galvanometer. 
3. Introduce a high resistance R ($\approx5000\ \Omega$) from the resistance box R. Close the key $K_1$ (keeping $K_2$) open. Adjust the value of resistance R till the deflection $\theta$ in the galvanometer is almost full scale and is an even number of divisions. Note the deflection $\theta$ and the value of resistance R. 
4. Introduce a small resistance ($\approx 50\ \Omega$) through low resistance box S and close the key $K_2$. Keeping R fixed, adjust the value of shunt resistance S till the deflection in the galvanometer is reduced to exactly half the value of $\theta$ obtained in step 3, i.e., deflection becomes $\theta/2$. No the deflection and the value of shunt resistance S. 
5. For different values of R and S, take three more sets of observations by repeating steps 3 and 4 so that $\theta$ is even number of divisions. Record the observations of R, S, $\theta$ and $\theta/2$ in a tabular form. 
6. Calculate the value of galvanometer resistance using the formula, $G = \frac{RS}{R-S}$.

### [B] Figure of merit of the galvanometer 
7. Find the emf $\mathcal{E}$ of the battery by connecting it across a high resistance voltmeter. See that the +ve terminal of the battery is connected to the +ve terminal of the voltmeter. 
8. As shown in the figure, connect the battery $\mathcal{E}$, galvanometer G, high resistance box R and a key K in series. 
9. Introduce a resistance of about 5000 $\Omega$ from resistance box R. Insert the plug key in K and adjust the resistance R so that almost a full scale deflection of certain complete number of divisions is obtained in the galvanometer. Note the values of R and $\theta$. 
10. Repeat the experiment for three more values of R so that deflections lie between 20-30 divisions. Record the values of R and $\theta$ in a tubular form. 
11. Calculate the figure of merit of the galvanometer using the formula, $k = \frac{\mathcal{E}}{(R+G)\theta}$.

## Observations and Calculations 

## Result 
1. Resistance of galvanometer by half-deflection method, $G$ = $\Omega$.
2. Figure of merit of the galvanometer, $k$ = $A\ \text{div}^{-1}$.
3. Current required for full scale deflection in the galvanometer, $I_g = A$

## Precautions 
1. All the connections show be neat, clean and tight. 
2. All the plugs of the two resistance boxes should be kept tight by giving them a gentle twist. 
3. The value of the series resistance R should be large. This ensures correct value of G. 
4. To decrease the deflection in the galvanometer, the shunt resistance S should be decreased. 
5. The emf of the battery should remain constant. For this, a freshly charged battery should be used. 

## Sources of Error 
1. The plugs in the resistance boxes may not be clean or tight. 
2. the emf of the battery may not be constant. 
3. The divisions on the galvanometer scale may not be of equal size.
