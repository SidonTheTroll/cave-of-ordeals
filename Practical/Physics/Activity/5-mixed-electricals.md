## Aim of the Activity  
To identify a diode, an LED, a resistor and a capacitor from a mixed collection of such items. 

## Apparatus and Material Required 
1. Multimeter 
2. Mixed collection of diode, LED, resistor and capacitor. 

## Theory 
- **Diode**: a two terminal device which conducts current when forward biased and not when reverse biased. It does not emit light during its conduction. 
- **LED**: a light emitting diode is a two terminal device which conducts current when forward biased and not when reverse biased. It emits a characteristic light during its conduction. 
- **Resistor**: a two terminal device which conducts equally in both direction. 
- **Capacitor**: a two terminal device which offers infinite resistance to DC but has finite reactance for AC. When connected across a DC source, a multimeter shown a large current initially (for C > $\mu$F) which decreases to zero quickly. This is because the capacitor initially draws a charge.

## Observations 
| Item Code | State of conduction of a component | Identified component | 
|:-:|:-|:-:|
| A | Conducts equally in both directions | Resistor | 
| B | Conducts in one direction without emission of light | Diode | 
| C | Conducts in one direction with emission of light | LED | 
| D | Does not conduct, gives an initial deflection which decays to zero | Capacitor |

## Result 
From the mixed grouping of components, the components marked A, B, C and D have been identified as resistor, diode, LED and capacitor respectively. 

## Precautions 
1. While checking the conduction state of any component, clean its leads properly. 
2. Use the selector switch of the multimeter in resistance mode with highest range option. 
3. While testing any component, avoid touching the metal end of either of multimeter probe. Body resistance in parallel with the component resistance may create confusion about the conduction state of the component.
