## Aim of the Activity 
To study the variation in potential drop with length of a wire for a steady current. 

## Apparatus and Material Required 
1. Potentiometer 
2. Battery of three dry cells/battery eliminator 
3. Voltmeter (0-3 V)
4. Ammeter (0-3 A)
5. Plug key 
6. Jockey 
7. Low resistance rheostat 
8. Connecting wires
9. Piece of sand paper 

## Theory 
A potentiometer works on the principle that if a constant current flows through a wire of uniform area of cross-section and composition, then the potential drop V across any length $l$ of the wire is 

$$
V \propto l \text{ or } V = kl \text{ or } k = \frac{V}{l}
$$

Here $k$ is the potential drop per unit length and is called potential gradient. 

## Circuit Diagram 

## Procedure 
1. Draw a neat circuit diagram and arrange the required apparatus accordingly on the working table. 
2. Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the end A (zero end) of the potentiometer wire and negative terminal to the end B (400 cm length), through a plug key K, ammeter A, and low resistance rheostat Rh. 
3. Now connect the positive terminal of the voltmeter V to the end A of the potentiometer wire and its negative terminal to the jockey J which can slide along the wire AB. 
4. Note that the pointer of the voltmeter with the help of zero adjustment screw provided on its front panel. 
5. Insert the plug in the key K and press the jockey J at the extreme end B of the potentiometer wire. Adjust the sliding contact of the rheostat so that voltmeter shows full scale deflection.
6. Now press the jockey at point A, the voltmeter will show zero deflection. 
7. Now press the jockey at 40 cm (from end A) and note the corresponding reading.
8. Now make contacts of the jockey at distances 80 cm, 120 cm, 160 cm, ..., 400 cm from the end A and note the potential drop V in each case. See that the ammeter reading remains constant throughout. Record all your observations in a tabular form. 
9. Calculate potential gradient $k=V/l$ for each observation.

## Observation and Calculations 
- Range of the voltmeter = 0 to V 
- Least count of the voltmeter = V 
- Range of the ammeter = 0 to A 
- Steady current in the ammeter = A

- Mean value of k = $V cm^{-1}$

## Plotting Graph 
Choosing suitable scales, plot a graph of V versus I, with V along Y-axis and l along X-axis. A straight line graph is obtained as shown. 

$$
\text{Potential Gradient} = \text{Slope of I-V graph}\\
k = \frac{V_2-V_1}{l_2-L_1}
k = V cm^{-1}
$$

> [!CAUTION]
> Graph to be added later

## Result 
1. Within the limits of experimental error, the ration $V/l$ is found to be constant.  
This shows that $V \propto l$. Mean value of k = $V cm^{-1}$

2. V vs. l graph is straight line which again shows that $V \propto l$.  
Value of potential gradient from the graph, k = $V cm^{-1}$

## Precautions 
1. All connections should be neat, clean and tight.
2. The positive terminal of the auxiliary battery should be connected to the end A of the potentiometer wire. 
3. During experimentation, the current passing through the potentiometer wire must remain constant. This can be ensured by using an ammeter in the auxiliary circuit. If the current changes, it should be readjusted with the help of the low resistance rheostat. 
4. Zero error, if any, in the voltmeter and ammeter should be eliminated by adjusting the screw provided at the front panel. 
5. Do not drag the jockey along the wire while moving it from one point to another. It should be pressed gently at different positions of the wire.

## Sources of Error 
1. The area of cross-section of the potentiometer wire may not be uniform.
2. The resistance of the potentiometer wire may change due to heating.
3. Voltmeter readings may not be accurate.
