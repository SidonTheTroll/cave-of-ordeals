## Aim of the Experiment 
To find the value of v for different values of u in case of a concave mirror and find its focal length.

## Apparatus and Material Required 
1. Optical bench with three uprights
2. Two sharp edged needles 
3. One concave mirror of focal length less than 20 cm
4. Index needle/knitting needle 
5. Half-meter scale

## Working Formula 
The relation between object distance u, image distance v, and focal length f of a concave mirror is given by the mirror formula.

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \text{ or } f=\frac{uv}{u+v}
$$

## Observations 
- Rough focal length of concave mirror = 10 cm 
- Actual length of the knitting needle, x = 2.0 cm 
- Observed distance
