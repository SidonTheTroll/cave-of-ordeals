## Aim of the Experiment 
To determine the specific resistance of a material using a meter bridge.

## Apparatus Required
1. Meter bridge 
2. Different resistances or resistance coils
3. Resistance box 
4. Jockey 
5. One way key
6. Galvanometer 
7. Battery eliminator or Daniel cell
8. Thick connecting wires 
9. Sand paper 

## Theory 
### Working formula: 
Meter bridge is a form of Whetstone bridge, under balanced condition,

$$
\frac{P}{Q} = \frac{R}{X}
$$

1. For a meter bridge, the unknown resistance X is given by: 

$$
X = \frac{(100-l)}{l}\times Q
$$

Where, 
- X is the resistor of unknown resistance. 
- l is the balancing length. 
- Q is the resistance from resistance box. 

2. Specific resistance $(\rho)$ of the material is given by: 

$$
\rho = \frac{RA}{l} = \frac{4\pi D^2}{4l}
$$

Where, 
- D is the diameter of the given wire. 
- l is the length of wire. 
- X is the resistance of given wire. 

## Observation 
- **Material**: nichrome 
- **Least count of meter scale**= 0.1 cm 
- **Length**: 30 cm

- Mean value of S = 2.49 $\Omega$

## Result 
Resistance of the given wire = 2.49 $\Omega$

## Precautions 
1. All connections should be neat and tight. 
2. The plugs in the resistance box must be kept tight by giving a gentle twist after inserting. 
3. The jockey shouldn't be pressed too hard on the wire, else it will damage the uniformity of the meter bridge.
4. Move the jockey gently over the wire and do not rub it against the wire. 
5. The current through the bridge wire should not be passed for only as much time as is essential for getting the null point. 

## Sources of Error 
1. THe meter bridge's wire may not be of uniform area of cross-section due to its entire length. 
2. Due to prolonged flow of current, the wire gets heated up and its resistance changes. 
3. The galvanometer pointer may not be exactly at zero mark. It must be adjusted to zero by gently moving the screw at the bottom of the front panel with the help of a screw driver. 
4. The resistance offered by copper strips at the ends of the bridge wire may be faulty.
