2. Muscular strength and endurance 
    1. Abdominal/core strength
    2. Muscular endurance

# Body Mass Index (BMI)
Body Mass Index (BMI) is widely used measure to assess an individual's body weight relative to their height. It is also called Quetelet Index Because it was invented by Adolphe Quetelet. It is a uesful screening tool to categorize people into different weight categories, which can indicate potential health resks. The BMI is calculated using the following formula: 

$$
BMI = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height}^2 (\text{cm}^2)}
$$

## BMI Categories 
Based on the calculated BMI, individuals are classified into the following categories: 

1. **Underweight:** BMI less than 18.5
2. **Normal weight:** BMI 18.5 to 24.9
3. **Overweight:** BMI 25 to 29.9
4. **Obesity:** BMI 30 or greater 

## Importance of BMI 
1. **Health Indicator:** Bmi is a quick, non-invasive way to check if a person has a healthy weight. It's often used to gauge the rick of chronic diseases like heart diseases, diabetes and hypertension. 
2. **Population studies:** BMI is used in studies to track and compare the rates of underweight, overweight and obesity across different groups. 
3. **Health Guidance:** Doctors use BMI to identify people who might need weight management help, such as diet and exercise changes.

# Muscular Strength and Endurancce 
## Abdominal/Core Strength (Partial Curlup)
- **Purpose:** To assess abdominal muscle strength and endurance, it's important to note that strong abs help maintain good posture, align the hips and prevent lower back pain. 
- **Equipment Required:** A flat, clean and cushioned surface, recording sheet and pen. 

<br> 

- **Procedure:** Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat and arms by your sides. Slowly curl your shoulders off the floor, sliding your hands towards your knees.

## Normal/Modified Push Ups 
Normal push-ups (boys) involve lowering and lifting your body with your arms while keeping your body straight from head to heels. Modified push-ups (girls), done on your knees, reduce the intensity and are a great alternative for building strength. 

- **Purpose:** To test or measure the upper body strength and endurance. 

- **Equipment Required:** A floot mat and a paper to record basic information such as age, gendes and total number of push-ups performed. 

- **Procedure:** For normal push-ups, start in a plank position with arms straight and hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your chest to the floor, then push back up. For modified push-ups, begin on your knees and perform the same movement. Repeat for desired number of repeats. 

- **Scoring:** Record the total number of push-ups performed correctly. 

# 50 m Dash or 50 m Standing Start

- **Equipment Required:** Marked track, 2 stopwatches, flat and clean surface of 60 meters. 

- **Procedure:** For the 50 m dash or standing start, stand with feet shoulder-width apart at the start line, leaning slightly forward. On the signal, push off with both feet, driving forward with your arms and legs. Accelerate quickly, maintaining an upright posture and pumping your arms to build speed. Sprint through to the finish line, keeping a steady pace. 

- **Scoring:** The score is recorded in seconds to the nearest 10th of a second. 

# 600 m Run/Walk 
- **Purpose:** To measure the cardiovascular endurance. 

- **Equipment Required:** 600 m running area in 200 or 400 m track and stop watches. 

- **Procedure:** For the 600 m run/walk, start by jogging or walking at a comfortable pace. Maintaining a steady rhythm and focus on consistent breathing. If needed, alternate between running and walking to manage your stamina. Complete the distance by finishing with a strong, steady pace. 

- **Scoring:** Time is recorded in minutes and seconds. 

# Sit and Reach Test (Flixibility Test) 
- **Purpose:** To measure flexibility, particularly in the lower back and hamstrings. 

- **Equipment Required:** Sit and reach box or an improvised box with ruler. 

- **Procedure:** To perform the sit and reach test, sit on the floor with your legs extended straight ahead and feet against the box.
