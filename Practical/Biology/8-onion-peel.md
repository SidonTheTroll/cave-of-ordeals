## Aim of the Experiment 
To study the process of meiosis in onion buds cells through prepared slides. 

## Materials Required 
1. Onion root tip sample 
2. Aceto-alcohol fixative
3. Carmine solution 
4. Glass slide 
5. Cover slide 
6. Microscope 
7. Needle 
8. Section lifter
9. Filter paper 
10. Eraser 
11. Pen
12. Scissors 
13. Watch glass 
14. Test tube 
15. Burner 

## Procedure 
1. Cut the root tips of the onion and put them on a watch glass. 
2. Also put some solution of aceto-alcohol to fix the state of cells as it is. 
3. Use a section lifter to insert all the samples in a test tube containing acetocarmine solution. 
4. Heat the test tube till boiling temperature to make sure the chromosomes of the tissue sample is dyed. 
5. Place the sample in glass slide and cover it with a cover slip with the help of needle to make sure no air bubbles are inside. 
6. Fold a filter paper and place it on the cover slide and with the help of eraser and pencil, compress the sample so that it makes a very thin film. 
7. Place it on a microscope and adjust the magnification to observe the cells with colored chromosomes. 

## Observations
The following stages of meiosis has been observed under high power of microscope in onion bud cells.

1. **Prophase-I**
    1. **Leptotene**: the chromosomes make their appearance as long and thin threads in the nucleus. Each chromosomes is formed of two chromatids joined together by centromere. 
    2. **Zygotene**: there is pairing of homologous chromosomes. 
    3. **Pachytene**: the paired chromosomes become shorter and thicker.
    4. **Diakinesis**: chromosomes becomes shorter and thicker. Nuclear membrane and nucleolus almost disappear. Spindle formation starts. Centriole divides into two and astral rays are formed around each centriole to form aster. 
2. **Metaphase-I**: Bivalent chromosomes arrange themselves the equatorial plate in two rows that their centromere face towards the poles and the chromatids' arm towards the equatorial plate. 
3. **Anaphase-I**: Each chromosome consisting of two chromatids separate and move towards the opposite poles. The parental chromosome number is reduced to half and towards each pole, one haploid set of chromosomes move. 
4. **Telophase-I**: The nuclear membrane is formed around each group of chromosomes. Chromosomes undergo decondensation and spindle fibers disappear. Nucleolus is not recognized in each daughter cell. 
- **Cytokinesis**: It occurs by formation of cell plate almost in the middle of the cell. This gradually moves apart centrifugally and ultimately divides the cell into two parts. 
5. **Prophase-II**: Nucleus shows very clear and distinctive chromosomes. Each chromosome appears as two threaded structures which are joined by a specialized region, the centromere. Nuclear membrane starts dissolving. 
6. **Metaphase-II**: Nuclear membrane disappears and spindle are formed. Chromosomes arrange themselves at the equatorial portion of the spindle. The chromosomes are half in number and their are thick, short and condensed. 
7. **Anaphase-II**: Chromosomes split at the centromeres region and each chromosome forms two daughter chromatids. They move apart from the equatorial plate to the opposite poles. 
8. **Telophase-II**: The chromatids start aggregating at the opposite poles with half the number of chromosomes. The nuclear wall and nucleolus reappear and chromosomes become thin and long. 
- **Cytokinesis**: a cell plate is formed at the equatorial plate. This plate start in the center and extends centrifugally until it divides the cell into two parts. 

## Precautions 
1. Test tube should be heated equally in a slanting way. 
2. Thin film is required to avoid overlapping of the cells on the glass slide. 
3. Maximum light should hit through mirror for a clear image on the microscope. 
4. Hands should be washed with soap after the experiment to remove the stain. 

## Conclusion 
The experiment effectively demonstrated the stages of meiosis in onion bud cells. Distinct phases, from Prophase-I to Telophase-II, were observed under the microscope, showing chromosome pairing, separation, and haploid cell formation. This highlights meiosis's role in maintaining chromosome numbers and ensuring genetic variation.

## Viva
1. Aceto-alcohol fixative is used to bring the cell's activity to stasis. 
2. Fixative denatures the protein and lipids so there is no enzyme action and no further cell division. 
3. Acetic acid fixes the pH level and preserves the nucleic acid and proteins by fixing cellular structures, maintaining the shape and details of the cell.
4. Acetocarmine stain is used to color the chromosomes of the cell. 
5. Acetocarmine is prepared by adding carmine powder in 45% glacial acetic acid. 1 liter has 10 g powder and is kept for 24 hours stored in 4 degree celsius to avoid denaturation.
6. Carmine powder is also called **Coccus carmine** and is obtained from *Dactylopius coccus*. 
7. Iron rust can also be used to intensify the coloration. 
8. Dividing cells of the onion are only seen during 8-9 am.
