- Aim: **To study mitosis in onion root tip.**

- Aceto-alcohol fixative: brings the cell activity to stasis.
    - Alcohol (methanol): stops the division and fixes it. 
    - Acetic acid: preserves nucleic acids and proteins by fixing cellular structures, maintaining the shape and detail of cells

> [!NOTE]
> The division of onion cells is only seen around 8-9 am. 

Acetocarmine dye is used to color the chromosomes of the cells.  
Carmine is a derivative from *coccus carmine* which is an insect that lives in cactus. 

### Procedure
1. The root tips are cut into fine pieces. 
2. Fixative solution is prepared. 
3. Dye is taken in a test tube. 
4. Tissue sample is dipped in fixative. 
5. Sample is boiled in dye to color chromosomes. 
6. Filter paper is used to absorb all the dye while the sample is pressed between glass slide and cover slide to get a very thin layer. 

### Precautions 
1. Tube should be heated equally in a slanting way. 
2. Thin film is required to avoid overlapping. 
3. Maximum light should hit through mirror. 
4. Dye penetrates the upper cell so hand is also stained. 

### Viva
1. Fixative denatures the protein and lipids so there is no enzyme action and no further cell division. 
2. Acetic acid also fixes the pH level 
3. Acetocarmine is prepared by adding carmine powder in 45% glacial acetic acid. 1 liter has 10 g powder and is kept for 24 hours stored in 4 degree celsius to avoid denaturation.
4. Iron rust can also be used to intensify the coloration.
