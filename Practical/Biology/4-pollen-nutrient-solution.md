# Aim of the Experiment
To prepare a temporary mound to observe pollen germination. 

# Materials Required
Pollen grains of a flower, nutrient solution (sucrose, boric acid, magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate), needle, cavity slide, cover slide, microscope. 

--- 

> Boron is required for germination  
> Boric acid gives acidic medium for...  
> $MgSO_4$ maintains osmotic balance.  
> $KNO_2$ helps with osmotic balance and enzyme and protein 
>
> **Nutrient medium**: Sucrose, boric acid, magnesium sulphate, potassium nitrate.
