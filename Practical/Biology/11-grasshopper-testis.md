## Aim of the Experiment
To study the process of meiosis in grasshopper testis through permanent slides. 

## Materials Required 
Permanent slides of meiosis in different stages in grasshopper testis and microscope. 

## Procedure 
Fix the permanent slides of meiosis one by one firstly under low power and then shift them under high power of microscope. 

## Observations
The following stages of meiosis in grasshopper testis has been observed under high power of microscope.  
This process of meiosis takes place in two steps namely, Meiosis I and Meiosis II.  
Meiosis I is completed under Prophase I, Metaphase I, Anaphase I and Telophase I. 

### 1. Prophase I  
It is very complex and of long duration. It is completed under five sub-stages- leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis.

#### 1. Leptotene 
1. The size and volume of nucleus increases. 
2. Chromosomes become visible due to condensation, shortening and thickening. 
3. Chromosomes appear to be single stranded and thread like where their end face towards nuclear envelope. 
4. Chromosomes show a beaded appearance along the entire length and are called chromomeres. 

#### 2. Zygotene 
1. The homologous chromosomes start pairing known as the pairing of chromosomes or synapsis. THe complex formed by a pair of synapsed homologous chromosomes is called bivalent or a tetrad. 
2. The chromosomes become more distinct by shortening and coiling. 
3. Centrioles emit asters and polarity of spindle is established. 

#### 3. Pachytene 
1. The paired chromosomes or bivalent become shorter, thicker, or more prominent. 
2. Each chromosome splits longitudinally into two sister chromatids and bivalent becomes a tetrad. 
3. Crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids where they partially coil around each other for exchange of hereditary material or genes. The place at which crossing over takes place is known as chiasmata. 

#### 4. Diplotene 
1. The synaptic forces between the paired homologous come to an end. 
2. Chiasma become more conspicuous and they start slipping towards end of bivalents. 
3. The chromosomes undergo further condensation and they appear elongated. 

#### 5. Diakinesis 
1. The separated chromosomes move towards the nuclear membrane and coincide with the disappearance of nuclear membrane and nucleolus. 
2. The chromosomes are fully condensed and get randomly distributed in the cytoplasm. 
3. The centriole gets divided into two and astral rays are formed around each centriole to form aster. 
4. The spindle formation starts. 

Diakinesis represents transition in metaphase. 

### 2. Metaphase I 
1. The spindle formation is completed. 
2. The bivalent arrange themselves at the equatorial plates in two planes which are parallel to each other. 
3. The chromosomes are attached to the spindle fibers by the centromere. 
4. The centromeres of chromosomes face towards the poles and chromatids towards the equator. 
5. It is followed by cytokinesis and this is called diad of cells and two haploid daughter cells are formed. 

### Anaphase I 
1. The centromere doesn't divide into two and two chromatids of each chromosome remains joined together by centromere. 
2. Each chromosome consisting of two chromatids, move towards the opposite respective poled due to longitudinal contraction of spindle fibers. 
3. Each pole receives the one haploid set of chromosomes. 

### Telophase I
1. Chromosomes undergo decondensation at each pole.
2. Nuclear membrane reappears around daughter chromosomes at each pole. 

### Meiosis II 
#### Prophase II 
1. The sister chromatids become coiled and turn thicker and shorter. 
2. Each chromosome consists of two chromatids joined by centromere. 

#### Metaphase II 
1. A mitotic spindle is formed. 
2. The chromosomes arrange themselves at the equatorial plane and are attached with the spindle by their kinetochores of sister chromatids. 

#### Anaphase II 
1. The centromere of each chromosome separate.
2. The sister chromatids migrate to the opposite poles as daughter chromosomes. 

#### Telophase II 
1. Chromosomes begin to uncoil and become thin. 
2. Nuclear membrane and nucleolus are reformed. 

Telophase II is followed by cytokinesis and it is cleavage type in animal cells and phragmoplast plate formation in plant cells.
