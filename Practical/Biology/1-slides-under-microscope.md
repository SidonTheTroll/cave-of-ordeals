# TS of Testis
## Observations
<img align=right src="./img/ex-1/testis.jpg" width=400>

- Testis is covered by three layers- *tunica vaginalis* (outermost), *tunica albuginea* (middle layer) and *tunica vasculosa* (innermost).
- It carries numerous seminiferous tubules in the form of loops. 
- The connective tissues are found around the seminiferous tubules containing masses of interstitial cells (leydig's cells), blood vessels and nerve fibers. 
- The lining of seminiferous tubules is formed by cuboidal *spermatogenic* cells and *sertoli* cells.
- Spermatogenic cells are stacked and are present in the form of spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, spermatids and sperms. 
- Sertoli cells are elongated and pyramidal and are found between the germinal epithelium of seminiferous tubules. 

# TS of Ovary 
## Observations
<img align=right src="./img/ex-1/ovary.jpg" width=400>

- A solid structure surrounded by germinal epithelium and is followed by *tunica albuginea* (fibrous tissue)
- The inner mass of the ovary is differentiated into the outer _cortex_ and inner *medulla*.
- The germinal epithelium forms *primordial follicles* which migrate into the ovarian cortex.
- The medulla contains primary follicles, vesicular follicles and Graafian follicles. 
- The mature follicles (graafian) contain a large ovum in the fluid-filled cavity (antrum) surrounded by many layers of follicular cells (theca externa, theca interna, membrana granulosa and germ hill).
- Medulla also contains blood vessels, nerve fibers and various smooth muscles.
- Cortex contains large masses of *corpus luteum* (large masses of yellow cells) formed by the rupture of Graafian follicles after the release of ovum (ovulation).

# Blastocyst 
## Observations 
<img align=right src="./img/ex-1/blastula.png" width=400>

- It is a spherical mass of cells. 
- It carries a fluid-filled cavity called blastocoel. 
-  It is surrounded by an outer envelope of cells called trophoblast or trophoectoderm.
-  It also carries a group of inner mass cells (embryoblast) in the blastocoel cavity. 
-  The embryoblast (inner mass cells) later form the embryo and the trophoblast gets attached to the endometrium layer of the uterus for implantation.

# Plasmodium 
<img align=right src="./img/ex-1/plasmodium.png " width=400>

**Kingdom**: Protista  
**Phylum**: Apicomplexa  
**Class**: Aconoidasida  
**Order**: Haemosporida  
**Family**: Plasmodiidae  
**Genus**: *Plasmodium*  
**Species**: *vivax*

- **Disease caused:** Malaria 

## Identifying Features
- Plasmodium enters humans as sporozoites via female Anopheles mosquito bites.
- Infected by biting humans, female Anopheles mosquitoes store and multiply Plasmodium parasites in their salivary glands, transmitting sporozoites to humans when they bite again.
- Sporozoites, single-nucleated, spindle-shaped organisms, display wriggling motion. 
- Plasmodium needs both humans and mosquitoes to complete its life cycle, with the female Anopheles mosquito as the vector. 
- Plasmodium multiplies in liver cells, then rupture RBCs, releasing the toxin *haemozoin*.

## Symptoms 
1. Headache and nausea 
2. Chill, shiver, then fever recurs every 3 to 4 days.
3. Fever is subsidized by profuse sweating. 

# Entamoeba

## Identifying features
- It's a human intestinal/rectal endoparasite.

# Lichen 
<img align=right width=400 src="./img/ex-1/fruticose.png">

**Kingdom**: Fungi  
**Phylum**: Ascomycota  
**Class**: Lecanoromycetes  
**Order**: Lecanorales  
**Family**: Cladoniaceae  
**Genus**: *Cladonia*  
**Species**: *portentosa*

## Identifying Features
- It exhibits a fruticose growth form, featuring upright stalks resembling miniature trees. It displays a grayish-green to bluish-green coloration.
- The thallus typically comprises branched and shrubby structures with multiple podetia.
- The podetia, resembling miniature trees, are a distinctive feature of *Cladonia portentosa*.
- It commonly shows a grayish-green to bluish-green coloration.
- *Cladonia portentosa* thrives in forests, woodlands, and urban areas with moderate humidity, aiding in soil formation and nutrient cycling, and providing habitat and food for various organisms.

## Mode of Reproduction
### Asexual Reproduction 
- *Soredia:* Small clusters of algal cells surrounded by fungal hyphae. They break off from the parent lichen and can grow into new lichens when dispersed by wind or animals.
- *Isidia:* Tiny, finger-like projections containing both fungal and algal cells. They detach from the parent lichen and can initiate new lichens when dispersed.

### Sexual Reproduction
- *Ascospores:* Produced within specialized structures called asci, formed in reproductive structures called apothecia. Ascospores are released into the environment and can germinate to form new lichens if they encounter a compatible algal partner.

# Precautions
- The microscope should be set up under low power and then changed to high power objective lens to observe the slide clearly. Never use the microscope under high power directly. 
- Fine adjustment knob should be used to focus the slide under high power. Care should be taken that the objective lens should not touch the slide in any case. 
- Specimen should be handled with care and hold the container upright if stored with preservative liquid. 
- If handling live specimens, use proper specific procedures. 
- Handle permanent slides with care so as not to break them.
