## Aim of the Experiment 
To extract DNA from spinach leaves. 

## Material Required
1. Spinach leaves
2. Blender 
3. Salt 
4. Dish washing soap 
5. 70-95% isopropyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol
6. Spoon
7. Meat tenderizer
8. Beaker 
9. Measuring cup
10. Strainer 

## Procedure 
1. Take 1/2 cup of spinach leaves. Put them in a blender with one cup of water and one table spoon of salt. 
2. Blend it at high speed so that it may become 'soupy' mixture.
3. Pour the soupy mixture through a strainer into class measuring cup or beaker. Now add 1/6 of liquid detergent to the total volume and swirl to mix for about ten minutes. 
4. Add a pinch of meat tenderized to the mixture.
5. Now add rubbing alcohol to it. Alcohol caused the DNA to precipitate.

## Observation
DNA is spooled on a glass stirring rod or on a wooden stick. It appears as white precipitate of very fine threads on the spool.

## Precautions
1. Eyes should be protected while performing experiment by wearing goggles and spectacles.
2. Blender must be used carefully.
3. Gloves should be used to protect the hands from detergents.
