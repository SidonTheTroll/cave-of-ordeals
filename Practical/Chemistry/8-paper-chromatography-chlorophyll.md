# Aim of the Experiment 
To separate the colored components (pigments) from the extract of leaves and flowers by paper chromatography and determine the $R_f$ value of the components.

# Apparatus Required
Whatman's filter paper no. 1 of size 20 cm x 4 cm, glass jar, glass rod, a fine capillary tube, rubber cork having a hook in the center, test tube, scale, pencil, thick/broad adhesive tape, pestle and mortar. 

# Chemical Required 
Extract of flowers and leaves, distilled water, methanol or acetone and petroleum ether. 

# Theory 
Chromatography is an efficient technique for separating, purifying and testing the purity of elements and compounds. It relies on the selective distribution of mixture components between a stationary phase and a moving phase. Various types of chromatography have been developed based on the nature of these phases.

1. Column chromatography
2. Thin layer chromatography
3. Paper chromatography
4. Gas chromatography

In 1941, Martin and Synge developed Paper Chromatography, where a mixture is spotted on a filter paper strip and dipped in a solvent. As the solvent rises, it carries the mixtureâ€™s components at different rates, separating them. This separation is visible on the paper and can be quantified using the retention factor (\(R_f\)), which is the ratio of the distance traveled by the component to the distance traveled by the solvent.

$$
R_f = \frac{\text{Distance traveled by the solute from the original line (cm)}}{\text{Distance traveled by the solvent from the original line (cm)}}
$$

# Procedure 
1. Using a mortar and pestle, grind fresh flowers with 2 ml of acetone or methanol into a semi-liquid paste.
2. Filter the paste, collect the filtrate in a test tube, and close the test tube with a cork.
3. Similarly, grind leaves using the same method, collect the filtrate in another test tube and close it with a cork.
4. Take a 20 cm x 4 cm strip of Whatman's filter paper No. 1, and draw a vertical line 4 cm from the bottom with a pencil.
5. Draw a horizontal line across the middle of the paper so that it intersects the vertical line at the bottom of the strip.
6. Using a fine capillary, place a spot for the leaf extract (A) and another spot for the flower extract (B) on the vertical line, 1 cm apart from the intersection of the lines. Allow it to air dry. This process is called loading.
7. Repeat this process 2-3 times for proper loading.
8. Take 25 ml of a solvent mixture of petroleum ether and chloroform/acetone (20 ml petroleum ether + 5 ml chloroform/acetone) in a gas jar.
9. Now, suspend the chromatography paper strip freely in the gas jar, ensuring the reference point/vertical baseline does not touch or dip into the solvent, and the strip does not touch the sides of the gas jar (see figure 5.1).
10. Cover the gas jar and let the solvent rise to 60-70% of the paper strip's length (12-14 cm). 
11. Remove the paper from the gas jar and let it dry under shade.
12. Mark the center of each component with a pencil, then measure the distance traveled from the original reference line. Also, measure the distance traveled by the solvent from the same reference line.
13. Count the number of distinct spots to find the pigments in the leaf and flower extracts.
14. Record your observation in the table and calculate the retention factor $(R_f)$ for each component.
15. Attach the chromatography paper to your practical file with thick adhesive tape, covering the entire paper and sticking it to the file to prevent fading.

# Observations 
Name of the plant from which the flower and leaves are obtained: *Hibiscus mutabilis* 

1. Distance traveled by the solvent from the reference line: 
2. Distance traveled by green component (chlorophyll) from the base reference line: 
3. Distance traveled by yellow component (xanthophyll) from base reference line: 
4. Distance traveled by red component (carotene) from the base reference line: 

# Calculation 
1. $R_f$ value of green component: $\frac{A}{X}$
2. $R_f$ value of yellow component: $\frac{B}{X}$
3. $R_f$ value of red component: $\frac{C}{X}$

# Precations 
1. Use very fine thin capillary for loading the mixture.
2. Allow the spot to dry up before applying over another spot.
3. The spot should be between (2-4) mm in diameter.
4. The chromatography paper should be straight and should not touch the walls of the gas jar.
5. Spot should never dip in the solvent.
6. Do not disturb the gas jar once the Experiment is started.
7. Handle the solvents carefully.
8. Do not dry the chromatography paper in sunlight.

# Result 
The retention factor $(R_f)$ of the three components present in the extract of leaves and flowers are as follows:

Green =

Red =

Yellow =
