# Aim of the Experiment 
To identify the functional group present in the given organic compound. 

| Experiment | Observations | Inference |
|-|-|-|
| 1. **Test for unsaturation**: <br> Dissolve 0.2 ml of organic compound in 2 ml of $CCl_4$. Then bromine water drops are added.| Brown color of bromine is not discharged. | No unsaturation is present. | 
| 2. **Test for carboxylic group**: <br> Add a pinch of $NaHCO_3$ to 0.2 ml of organic compound in a test tube. | No effervescence | Carboxylic group is absent. | 
| 3. **Test for phenolic group**: <br> Add 0.2 ml of organic compound to 2-3 ml neutral $FeCl_3$ $\text{sol}^n$ in a test tube. | No green or violet color is obtained. | Phenolic group is absent. | 
| 4. **Test for alcoholic group**: <br> add a small piece of sodium to 1 ml of a given liquid in a test tube. | No effervescence | Alcoholic group is absent. | 
| 5. **Test for carbonyl group**: shake 0.2 ml of organic compound with 2-3 ml of 2,3 dinitrophenylhydrazine. | No ppt. formed. | Carbonyl group is absent. | 
| 6. **Test for ketonic group**: <br> add 1 ml of organic compound and 0.1 g of powdered n-dinitrobenzene and 1 ml of NaOH and shake the test tube. | Violet coloration | Ketonic group is present. | 

# Result 
The given organic compound contains ketonic $(R-CO-R)$ functional group.
