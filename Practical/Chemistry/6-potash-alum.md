# Aim of the Experiment 
To prepare crystals of double salt of potassium aluminium sulphate (potash alum).

# Apparatus Required 
Two beakers of 100 ml, a glass rod, a china dish, a funnel, filter papers, wash bottles, funnel stand, sand bath/wire gauze, tripod stand and a burner. 

# Chemical Required 
3 g of potassium sulphate, 12 g of aluminium sulphate, 1-2 ml of dilute sulphuric acid, ethanol and distilled water. 

# Theory
The additional compounds which are stable in solid state only but are broken down into individual constituents when dissolved in water are called double salts. Potash alum (phitkari) is a double salt which is prepared by dissolving equimolar quantity of potassium sulphate and aluminium sulphate in minimum quantity of water containing dilute sulphuric acid. The solution is filtered and heated in a china dish till the point of crystallization is reached and then cooled to obtain colorless octahedral crystals of potash alum. 

- **Chemical Equations**: 
    - $K_2SO_4+Al(SO_4)_3 \cdot 18H_2O + 6H_2O \rightarrow K_2SO_4 \cdot Al_2(SO_4)_3 \cdot 24H_2O$

# Procedure 
1. Take a clean and dry 100 ml beaker, add into it [3 g of potassium sulphate + 12 g of aluminium sulphate + 1-2 ml of dil. sulphuric acid]. Thoroughly mix the contents with a glass rod so as to wet the salts by sulphuric acid properly. This prevents the hydrolysis of potassium sulphate and aluminium sulphate when water is added to them. 
2. Take 50 ml of distilled water in another clean and dry 100 ml beaker and boil it for 2-3 minutes to expel out dissolved air. 
3. Add warm distilled water to the first beaker and stir with a glass rod until the salts dissolve completely, using the minimum amount of water needed.
4. Take a funnel and fit a filter paper cone in it and then place the funnel on funnel stand.
5. Pour the beaker's contents into the funnel using a glass rod. The filtrate collects in the china dish, while insoluble impurities remain on the filter paper. 
6. Place the china dish on a sand bath or wire gauze and gently heat it with a Bunsen burner. Stir the solution constantly with a glass rod to prevent boiling.
7. When the content of the china dish is reduced by 50%, dip the glass rod into the concentrated solution and cool it by blowing air. If a thin crust forms on the rod, the crystallization point is reached. 
8. Remove the china dish from the sand bath or wire gauze and cover it with a watch glass. Let it cool undisturbed. After some time, the crystals will separate out.
9. Seeding may be done if needed, i.e., by adding prepared crystals of the substance to increase the rate of crystallization. 
10. When sufficient crystals are formed decant of the mother liquor carefully without disturbing the crystals.
11. Add a small amount of ethanol + distilled water (1:1) in the china dish to wash the crystal and decant of the liquid.
12. Now place the crystals between folds of filter paper to obtain dry crystals. 

# Result 
**Weight of the crystals**: 10.2 g  
**Color of the crystals**: Colorless/white    
**Shape of the crystals**: Octahedral  

# Precautions 
1. Potash alum obtained should be colorless and not turbid. 
2. Sulphuric acid should be added before adding distilled water. 
3. Do not overheat the content. 
4. Cool the concentrated solution slowly.
5. Do not disturb the concentrated solution while cooling. 
6. Cover the china dish by watch glass while cooling the concentrated solution. 
7. Gently press the prepared crystals in between folds of filter paper to obtain undamaged crystals.
