## Aim of the Experiment 
To study the effect of change in temperature on the rate of reaction between sodium thiosulphate and hydrochloric acid. 

## Apparatus Required 
1. Conical flask (250 ml)
2. Measuring cylinder (50 ml)
3. Stopwatch 
4. Thermometer 
5. Tripod stand
6. Wire gauze 
7. Burner 

## Chemical Required 
1. $1M\ Na_2S_2O_3$ solution
2. $1M\ HCl$ 
3. Distilled water 
4. Conc. $HNO_3$

## Theory
The rate of reaction decrease with time as the concentration of reactants decreases. Thus, the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactants, i.e., sodium thiosulphate and hydrochloric acid. It can be verified by carrying out the experiment in which either the concentration of sodium thiosulphate is changed and keeping the concentration of $HCl$ the same or vice versa (at constant temperature). 

The reaction can be represented as: 

$\underset{\text{(Sodium thiosulphate)}}{Na_2S_2O_3} + 2HCl \rightarrow 2NaCl + H_2O + S$

The colloidal solution of sulphur so formed during the reaction gives turbidity to the solution which can be utilized to study the rate of reaction as turbidity increases with increase in time. 

## Procedure 
1. Take 50 ml of 0.1 M $Na_2S_2O_3$ solution in a 100 ml conical flask and note its temperature. 
2. Add 100 ml of 1 M $HCl$ to it and start stopwatch immediately when half of the $HCl$ solution has been added. 
3. Shake the contents of the flask gently and place it on the tile with a cross mark. 
4. Observe the cross mark formed from the top and note the time taken for the mark to become invisible. 
5. Empty the flask and clean it thoroughly with conc. $HNO_3$ and then with water.
6. Repeat the experiment at different temperature by using freezing mixture and hot water bath. 
7. Take 4-5 readings at different temperatures, having a gap of $10-15\degree C$. Record the observation in the table. 

## Observation
- Volume of 0.1 M $Na_2S_2O_3$ solution taken each time = 50 ml 
- Volume of 1 M $HCl$ added each time = 10 ml 

| S. No. | Temperature $(\degree C)$ | Time taken for the cross to become invisible | $1/t$ $(s^-)$ | 
|-|-|-|-|
| 1. | 39 | 165 s | 0.006 | 
| 2. | 49 | 145 s | 0.007 | 
| 3. | 59 | 125 s | 0.008 | 
| 4. | 69 | 85 s | 0.012 | 
| 5. | 79 | 65 s | 0.016 | 

## Plotting of Graph 
<img align=right src="./img/21-graph.jpg">

Plot a graph by taking $1/t$ along the ordinate (vertical axis) and temperature along the horizontal axis. 

## Result 
Rate of reaction between sodium thiosulphate and hydrochloric acid increased with increasing temperature. 

## Precautions 
1. Wash all the glass apparatuses. 
2. Do observe all readings from the same height.
3. Withdraw the exact volume of the solutions from the burette.                         
4. Do take all readings at temperature difference of $10-15\degree C$.
