# Qualitative Inorganic Analysis

</div>

Qualitative inorganic analysis is a vital aspect of chemistry, used in fields like medicine, criminology, and industry. It involves identifying radicals in inorganic salts. Inorganic salts result from acid-base reactions, with cations (basic radicals) and anions (acidic radicals). For example, in sodium chloride, $Na^+$ is the cation, and $Cl^-$ is the anion.

Before testing an inorganic substance, note its color, state, and solubility in water. Color and solubility provide initial clues about cations and anions.

The analysis includes wet and confirmatory tests. Preliminary dry tests are quick and involve observing the salt's appearance, smell, and solubility. They include heating, flame tests, borax bead tests, and more.

Solubility in water and solution $pH$ reveal ion information. Acidic or basic solutions indicate hydrolysis. Gases produced during tests with acids like $H_2SO_4$ provide insights about acid radicals. These dry tests are essential before confirmatory ion tests.

- The qualitative analysis of an inorganic substance is generally carried out in the following four parts: 
  1. Dry test for Basic Radicals 
  2. Dry test for Acidic Radicals 
  3. Wet test for anions (basic radicals)
  4. Wet test for cations (acidic radicals)

# Dry Test for Basic Radicals 

Perform this experiment by heating a small amount of salt in a dry test tube.   
Information from this test can give valuable clues, partly from observation of the residue and partly from identification of any gas evolved. Tabulate your observations along with the interferences that you can draw.
