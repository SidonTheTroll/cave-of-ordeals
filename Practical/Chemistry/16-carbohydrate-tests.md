## Aim of the Experiment 
To study some simple tests of carbohydrates. 

## Requirements 
1. Glucose 
2. Sucrose 
3. Lactose 
4. Starch 
5. Molisch's reagent 
6. Fehling's solution A and B
7. Iodine solutions 

## Procedure 
### 1. Molisch's test 
All carbohydrates give this test. Take 1-2 ml of aq. solution of carbohydrate and add two drops of Molisch's reagent (10% alcoholic solution of $\alpha$-naphthol). Put 1 ml of conc. $H_2SO_4$ slowly along the side of the test tube. A red-violet ring is produced at the junction of two layers. 
- **Chemistry of the test**: Conc. $H_2SO_4$ converts carbohydrates into furfural and its derivative which further reacts with $\alpha$-naphthol to give a colored product. 

### 2. Fehling's Test 
Take 2 ml of aq. solution of carbohydrate and add 1-2 ml of both Fehling's solution A and B. Keep the test tube in boiling water bath. 
- **Chemistry of the test**: 

### 3. Benedict's Test 
Take 1-2 ml of aq. solution of carbohydrates in a test tube. Add 2 ml of Benedict's reagent. Keep the test tube in a boiling water bath. Reddish ppt. indicates the presence of reducing sugar. 

### 4. Tollen's Test 
Take 2-3 ml of aq. solution of carbohydrates in a test tube. Add to it 2-3 ml of Tollen's reagent. Keep the test tube in a boiling wa ter bath for 10 minutes 
- **Chemistry of the test**: 

## Observation 
| S .No. | Sample | Molisch's Test | Fehling's Test | Tollen's Test | Inference | 
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 1. | Potato | Purple ring | Negative | Negative | Carbohydrate present | 
| 2. | Rice | Purple ring | Red ppt. | Red ppt. | Carbohydrate present | 
| 3. | Besan | Negative | Negative | Negative | Absent | 
| 4. | Sugar | Purple ring | Negative | Negative| Carbohydrate present | 
| 5. | Bread | Purple ring | Red ppt. | Red ppt. | Carbohydrate present | 

## Result 
Potato, rice, sugar and bread contains carbohydrates. 

## Precautions 
1. Use freshly prepared reagents for performing the test.
2. Use minimum amount of water.
