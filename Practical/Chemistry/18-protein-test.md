## Aim of the Experiment 
To study some simple tests for proteins.

## Requirement 
Egg white dispersion, gelatin dispersion, Millen's reagent, Ninhydrin reagent 

## Procedure 
### 1. Biuret Test 
To study the dispersion of the substance to the tested, add about 2 ml of $NaOH$ solution. Now add 4-5 drops of 1% of $CuSO_4$ solution. Warm the mixture for about 5 minutes. Bluish-violet coloration indicate the presence of protein. 

### 2. Ninhydrin Test 
Take about 2 ml of egg white in a test tube and add 3-4 drops of Ninhydrin solution. Boil the content. Intense blue coloration confirms the presence of proteins.

## Observation 
| S. No. | Sample | Biuret Test | Ninhydrin Test | Inference | 
|-|-|-|-|-|
| 1. | Besan | Blue-violet color | Intense blue color | Protein present | 
| 2. | Dal | Blue-violet color | Intense blue color | Protein present | 
| 3. | Apple | Negative | Negative | Protein absent | 
| 4. | Egg | Blue-violet color | Intense blue color | Protein present |
