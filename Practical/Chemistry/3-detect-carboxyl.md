# Aim of the Experiment 

To identify the function group present in the given organic compound. 

| Experiment | Observations | Inference | 
|-|-|-|
| 1. **Test for saturation**: <br> Dissolve 0.2 ml of organic compound in 2 ml of $CCl_4$. Then bromine water drops are added.| Brown color of bromine is not discharged. | No unsaturation is present. | 
| 2. **Test for phenolic group**: <br> Add 0.2 ml of organic compound to 2-3 ml neutral $FeCl_5$ $\text{sol}^n$ in a test tube. | No green or violet color is obtained. | Phenolic group is absent. | 
| 3. **Test for alcoholic group**: <br> add a small piece of sodium to 1 ml of a given liquid in a test tube. | No effervescence | Alcoholic group is absent. | 
| 4. **Test for carbonyl group**: shake 0.2 ml of organic compound with 2-3 ml of 2,3 dinitrophenylhydrazine. | No ppt. formed. | Carbonyl group is absent. | 
| 5. **Test for aldehydic group**: <br> warm 1 ml of organic compound with 1 ml of Tollen's reagent in a test tube over a water bath. | No formation on inner side of the test tube. | Aldehydic group is absent. | 
| 6. **Test for carboxylic group**: <br> Add a pinch of $NaHCO_3$ to 0.2 ml of organic compound in a test tube. | Brisk effervescence occured. | Carboxylic group is present. | 
| 7. **Test for amino group**: <br> to a small amount of organic liquid in a test tube, add 1 ml of conc. $HCl$ and a few drops of $CHCl_3$. Then add 2 ml of alc. $KOH$ $\text{sol}^n$ and warm the test tube. | No offensive smelling gas is evolved. | Amino group is absent. | 

# Result 
The given organic compound contains carboxylic $(COOH)$ functional group.
