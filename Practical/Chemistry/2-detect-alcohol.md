# Aim of the Experiment
To identify the functional group present in the given organic compound. 

|Experiment|Observations|Inference|
|-|-|-|
| 1. **Test for unsaturation**: <br> Dissolve 0.2 ml of organic compound in 2 ml of $CCl_4$. Then add bromine water droplets. | Brown color of brome is not discharged. | No unsaturation is present. | 
| 2. **Test for carboxylic group**: <br> Add a pinch of $NaHCO_3$ to 0.2 ml off organic compound in a test tube. | No effervescence | Carboxylic group is absent. | 
| 3. **Test for phenolic group**: <br> Add a 0.2 ml of organic compound to 2-3 ml neutral $FeCl_3$ colution in a test tube. | No green or violet color obtained | Phenolic group is absent. | 
| 4. **Test for carbonyl group**: <br> Shake 0.2 ml of organic compound with 2-3 ml of 2,3 dinitrophenylhydrazine. | No effervescence / no ppt is formed. | Carbonyl group is absent. | 
| 5. **Test for aldehydic group**: <br> Warm 1 ml of organic compound with 1 ml of Tallen's reagent in a test tube over a water bath. | No formation on inner side of test tube. | Aldehyde is absent. | 
| 6. **Test for alcoholic group**: Add a small piece of sodium to 1 ml of the given liquid in a dry test tube. | Effervescence occured | Alcoholic group is present. | 
| 7. **Test for amino group**: To a small amount of organic liquid in a test tube, add 1 ml of conc $HCl$ and a few drop of $CHCl_3$. Then 2 ml of alc. $KOH$ solution is added and test tube is warmed. | No offensive smelling gas is evolved. | Amino group is absent| 

# Result 
The given organic compound contains alcoholic $(-OH)$ functional group.
