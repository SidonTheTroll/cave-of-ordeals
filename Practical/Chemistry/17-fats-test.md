## Aim of the Experiment 
To study some simple tests for fats. 

## Requirement 
1. Chloroform 
2. Ethyl alcohol 
3. $KHSO_4$ crystals 
4. Furfural solution 
5. Butter 
6. Dal
7. Soybean oil 
8. Milk
9. Crushed sunflower seed 

## Procedure 
### 1. Solubility Test 

| Test tube | Solvent | Observation | Inference | 
|-|-|-|-|
| 1. | Water | 1. Sample is immiscible | Fat present | 
| | | 2. Sample is miscible | Fat present | 
| 2. | Alcohol | 1. Sample forms lower layer which dissolve on heating | Fat present | 
| | | 2. Sample doesn't dissolve | Fat present | 
| 3. | Chloroform | 1. Sample is miscible | Fat present | 
| | | 2. Sample is immiscible | Fat present | 

### 2. Translucent Spot Test 
Press a little of the substance in the folds of a filter paper. The appearance of translucent or greasy spot on the filter paper indicates the presence of fat. The spot grows larger on heating and drying the filter paper. 

## Observation 
| S. No. | Sample | Solubility Test | Translucence Test | Inference | 
|-|-|-|-|-|
| 1. | Butter | Positive | Greasy spot | Fat present | 
| 2. | Dal | Negative | Negative | Fat absent | 
| 3. | Crushed sunflower seed | Positive | Greasy spot | Fat present | 
| 4. | Soybean oil | Positive | Greasy spot | Fat present | 
| 5. | Milk | Positive | Greasy spot | Fat present | 

## Result
Butter, crushed sunflower seeds, soybean oil and milk contains fats.
