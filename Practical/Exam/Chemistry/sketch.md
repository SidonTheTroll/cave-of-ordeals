- **Required**: Practical notebook, annual project, lab coat, stationery. 
- **Roll:** 16633778
- **Room:** Biology lab
- To arrive at morning shift.

## Salt Analysis 
**Write the formulas for only the salts found to be present. Both acid and basic radical in separate formulas.** 

- **Salts:** Ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, aluminum sulfate, barium chloride 

When writing, show the absence of desired inference once or twice. 

| Acid Radical | Basic Radical |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Chloride, sulfate | Ammonium, Aluminum, Barium |

### Dry Test of Acid Radical
- Action of dilute $HCl$
    - One or two absent
- Action of conc. $H_2SO_4$
    - Show for chloride and write absent or present from the experiment.

### Wet Test for Acid Radical
- Chloride and sulfate 

### Wet Test for Basic Radical 
- Group Analysis 
    - **Group 0:** Ammonia 
    - **Group 3:** Aluminum 
    - **Group 5:** Barium
- Then write absent for other groups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - All salts are water soluble. 

## Functional Group Identification
> [!NOTE]
> **Write two working formulas for the functionl group found.** 
> - **Acid:** ester and sodium bicarbonate
> - **Alcohol:** ceric ammonium nitrate and ester 

## Redox Titration 
> [!NOTE]
> **Procedure isn't required for this experiment.**  
> Titration is only done for M/20 solution.
