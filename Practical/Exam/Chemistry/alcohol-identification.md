## Aim of the Experiment 
To test the presence of alcoholic group in the organic compound. 

## Apparatus Required 
1. Two test tube 
2. One test tube holder 
3. Reagents 

## Chemical Required 
1. Given organic compound 
2. Ceric ammonium nitric solution 
3. Acetic acid 
4. Conc. $H_2SO_4$

## Theory 
The general formula of alcoholic compound is $R-OH$ where $R$ represents alkyl. Organic compound which have $-OH$ group attach to the carbon chain (alkyl) are called alcoholic compounds or alcohols. The hydroxyl group $(-OH)$ is called alcoholic group. Depending up on the numbers of $OH$ groups, alcohols can be monohydric, di-hydric or tri-hydric. For example,

1. Butane-1-ol has only one $-OH$ group, hence monohydric alcohol. 
    - $CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-OH$
2. Butane-1, 4-diol has two $(-OH)$ group, hence it is dihydric alcohol.
    - $HO-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-OH$

Alcohols can also be classified as primary (1), secondary (2) and teritary (3) depending upon whether $-OH$ group is linked to primary, secondary and tertiary carbon atoms respectively. 

| S. No. | Name of Test | Experiment | Observation | Inference | 
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| 1. | Ceric ammonium nitric test | Take a clean test tube and add 1 ml of organic compound and distilled water and few drops of cerim ammonium nitric solution | Pink or red coloration | Presence of alcoholic group | 
| 2. | Ester test | Take a clean and dry test tube and add 2 ml organic acid, 1 ml acetic acid and few drops of conc. $H-2SO_4$ and warm it in water bath for about 5 minutes. | Pleasant fruity smell is detected | Presence of alcoholic group | 

### Reactions Involved
1. **Ceric ammonium nitric test:**
    - $\underset{\text{Alcohol}}{ROH} + \underset{\text{Ceric ammonium nitrate}}{(NH_4)_2Cl(NO_3)_6} \rightarrow \underset{\text{Pink}}{(ROH)_2Ce(NO_3)_4} + \underset{\text{Colorless}}{2NH_4NO_3}$
2. **Ester test:**
    - $\underset{\text{Alcohol}}{ROH} + \underset{\text{Acetic acid}}{CH_3COOH} \overset{\text{conc.} H_2SO_4}{\rightarrow} \underset{\text{Ester (fruity smell)}}{CH_3COOR} + H_2O$

## Result 
The given organic compounds contains an alcoholic group.
