## Aim of the Experiment 
To prepare 250 ml of M/20 standard solution of ferrous ammonium sulphate (Mohr's salt), With the help of this standard solution determine the concentration/molarity of the given $KMnO_4$ solution. 

## Apparatus Required 
1. Chemical balance 
2. Weight box 
3. Conical flask 
4. 250 ml conical flask
5. Burette stand 
6. Two 100 ml beakers
7. 10 ml pipette 
8. Funnel 

## Chemical Required 
1. Potassium permanganate solution 
2. Dilute sulfuric acid 
3. Distilled water 
4. Ferrous ammonium sulfate 

## Theory 
Ferrous ammonium sulfate is a double salt and act as a reducing agent against $KMnO_4$, whereas potassium permanganate act as an oxidizing agent and it oxidizes iron present in Mohr's salt. Hence the reaction between the two is a redox reaction therefore the titration is called Redox Titration. Potassium permanganate acts as a self indicator and the color at the end point changes from colorless to pink. 

To prepare M/20 solution of Mohr's salt, the weight of Mohr's salt required can be calculated by using the formula: 

$$
\text{Molarity} = \frac{W_b \times 1000}{M_b \times \text{ volume in ml}} \text{ or } W_b = \frac{\text{Molarity}\times M_b \times \text{volume in ml}}{1000}
$$

- $W_b$ = weight of Mohr's salt 
- $M_b$ = molecular mass of Mohr's salt = 392 g/mol 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- Molarity = M/20 

$$
W_b = \frac{392 \times 250}{20 \times 1000} = 4.9 g 
$$

- Weight of Mohr's salt required = 4.9 g

| S. No. | Volume of Mohr's salt solution | Initial Reading of Burette | Final Reading of Burette | Volume of $KMnO_4$ used | 
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1. | 10 ml | --- | --- | --- ml |
| 2. | 10 ml | --- | --- | --- ml |
| 3. | 10 ml | --- | --- | --- ml |
| 4. | 10 ml | --- | --- | --- ml | 

### Calculations 
$$
\text{Mohr's salt} vs. KMnO_4 \\
\underset{\text{Mohr's salt}}{n_1M_1V_1} = \underset{KMnO_4}{n_2M_2V_2}
\\
\text{As per ionic equation number of electrons lost or gained} 
\\
n_1 = 5 and n_2 = 1 
\\
1 \times M_1V_1 = 5 \times M_2V_2
\\
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{5V_2}
$$

- **Molecular mass of $KMnO_4$** = 158 
- **Molarity of $KMnO_4$ solution** = 0.05 M 
- **Strength of $KMnO_4$ solution** = $M_2 \times 158 g$ = 7.9 g/liter 

## Result 
- **Molarity of the given $KMnO_4$ solution** = 0.05 M 
- **Strength of given $KMnO_4$ solution** = 7.9 g/l 

## Precautions 
1. Always add dilute sulfuric acid into Mohr's salt solution while preparing. 
2. Always use distilled water for preparing the solution. 
3. Always add $KMnO_4$ solution drop wise else the solution will become brown due to $MnO_2$ formation. 
4. Always add dilute sulfuric acid into Mohr's salt solution while preparing.
