## Aim of the Experiment 
To test the presence of carboxylic group in the given organic compound. 

## Apparatus Required 
1. Test tube 
2. Test tube holder 
3. Water bath 
4. Glass rod 

## Chemical Required 
1. Given organic compound
2. Blue litmus paper
3. Acetic acid 
4. Conc. sulfuric acid 

## Theory 
Organic compounds which contain $-COOH$ group are called carboxylic acids 

*For example:*

These are organic acids and are weaker than mineral acid. The carboxyl group can be detected by litmus and ester test. 

| S. No. | Name of Experiment | Experiment | Observation | Inference | 
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| 1. | Litmus test | Take a clean and dry test tube and add into litmus paper | Blue litmus paper turns red | Carboxylic group is present | 
| 2. | Ester test | Take a clean and dry test tue and add into it | Pleasent fruity smell | Carboxylic group confirmed | 

### Reaction involved: 

- Ester test: 
    - $\underset{\text{Carboxylic acid}}{RCOOH} + \underset{\text{Alcohol}}{R'OH} \overset{H^+}{\rightarrow} \underset{ester}{RCOOR'} + H_2O$

## Result 
The given organic compound contain carboxylic group.
