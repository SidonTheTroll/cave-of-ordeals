# Salt Analysis

## Aim of the Experiment 
To detect/analyse of one anion and one cation in a given sample. 

## Apparatus Required
1. Test tubes
2. Boiling tube 
3. Beakers 
4. Glass rod 
5. Burner 
6. Wire Gauze 
7. Test tube holder 
8. Measuring cylinder
9. Test tube stand 
10. Corks 
11. Funnel 
12. Spatula 

## Chemical Required 
1. Given salt sample 
2. Reagents as per requirements of the test 

## Physical Characteristics 
- **Color:** *write from observation* 
- **Appearance:** *write from observation* 
- **Odor:** *write from observation* 
- **Solubility:** Water soluble

## Wet Test for Basic Radical 
1. Distilled water (hot/cold)
2. Dilute $HCl$ (hot/cold)
3. Concentrated $HCl$ (hot/cold)

Solubility of inorganic salt in the above solvents may often help to identify some basic radicals.

| <center> Solvent | <center> Salt | 
|:-|:-|
| 1. Cold water | (a) All $NH_4$, $Na$ and $K$ salts. 
| | (b) All nitrates, nitrites and acetates | 
| | (c) Most of the sulfates except those of $Pb,\ Ba,\ Ca,\ Sr$
| | (d) All chlorides exceps that of lead | 
| 2. Hot water | Lead chloride, lead nitrate 
| | All carbonates which don't dissolve in water, i.e., carbonates of $Ca,\ Ba,\ Sr,\ Mg,\ Fe,\ etc$ but not of $PbS$

The usual procedures for analyzing a salt involves the systematic separation of basic radicals into groups. The table given below gives briefly the classification of basic radicals into groups of reagents and the form in which they are precipitated. 

<div align=center>

| <center> Group | <center> Group Reagent | <center> Basic Reagent | <center> Form in which basic radicals are precipitated | 
|:-:|:-|:-:|:-:|
| 1. | Dilute $HCl$ | $Pb^{2+},\ Hg^{2+}(\text{ous}),\ Ag^+$ | Chlorides | 
| 2. | $H_2S$ in presence of dilute $HCl$ | $Pb^{2+},\ Cu^{2+},\ As^{3+},\ Hg^{2+},\ Cd^{2+},\ Bi^{3+},\ Sb^{3+},\ Sn^{2+}$ | Sulfides | 
| 3. | $NH_4OH$ in presence of $NH_4Cl$ | $Fe^{3+},\ Al^{3+},\ Cr^{3+}$ | Hydroxides | 
| 4. | $H_2S$ in presence of $NH_4OH$ | $Ni^{2+},\ Mn^{2+},\ Zn^{2+},\ Co^{2+}$ | Sulfides | 
| 5. | $(NH_4)_2CO_3$ in the presence of $NH_4OH$ | $Ca^{2+},\ SrA^{2+},\ Be^{2+}$ | Carbonates 
| 6. | --- | $Mg^{2+},\ Na,\ K$ | --- |

### Division of the Basic Radicals (cations) in Different Groups (group separation)

| <center> Experiments | <center> Observation | <center> Inference | 
|-|-|-|
| $1.$ Add dilute $HCl$ to the salt solution. | White ppt | Group I present | 
| $2.$ Add dilute $HCl$ to the salt solution and then pass $H_2S$ gas | Black ppt | Group 2 present | 
| $3.$ Boil salt solution with salt + $HCl$ and add $NH_4Cl$ and $NH_4OH$ solution in excess | | Group 3 present | 
| | (a) Reddish-brown ppt | $Fe$ salt | 
| | (b) White gelatinous ppt | $Al$ salt |
| $4.$ Add $NH_3Cl$ and $NH_4OH$ to salt solution and pass $H_2S$ gas | | Group 4 present | 
| | (a) Black ppt | $Co$ salt | 
| | (b) Pink ppt | $Mn$ salt | 
| | (c) White ppt | $Zn$ salt | 
| $5.$ Add $NH_4OH$ and $(NH_4)_2CO_3$ to the salt solution | White ppt | Group 5 present maybe $Ca,\ Ba,\ Sr$ salt | 
| $6.$ No particular group reagent | --- | Group 6 $Mg$ salt |

## Wet Test for Acid Radical 
| Experiment | Observation | Inference | 
|-|-|-|
| 1. Extract + dil. $HCl$ + $BaCl_2$ + heat | White ppt. | $SO_4^{2-}$ present | 
| 2. Extract + dil. $HNO_3$ + $AgNO_3$ | White ppt. | $Cl^-$ present | 
| 3. Extract + dil. $HCl$ + $BaCl_2$ + $Br_2 (aq)$ + heat | No white ppt. | $SO_3^{2-}$ absent | 
| 4. Extract + dil. $H_2SO_4$ + $BaCl_2$ + $FeSO_4$ + conc. $H_2SO_4$ | No brown ring | $NO_3^-$ absent | 

## Conclusion 
From the experiments conducted above it is found that the given salt was ***salt name here*** (Ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, aluminum sulfate, barium chloride)

### Reactions involved: 
1. **Chloride ions $(Cl^-)$:** 
    - $Cl^- + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow HSO_4^- + HCl$
    - $HCl + NH_4OH \rightarrow NH_4Cl + H_2O$
2. **Sulfate ions?
