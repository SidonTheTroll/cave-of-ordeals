# Electric Charges and Fields 

- **Electric charge**: the property of a material due to which it can exert electrostatic force on material/object. 

- Types:
    1. **Negative**: execss of electron 
    2. **Positive**: deficit of electron 

# Mass Comparison on Charging
If the object are in same conditions, then: 

1. Mass decreases when positively charged. 
2. Mass increases when negatively charged. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Charge of $e^- = -1.6 \times 10^{-19} C$
> - Charge of $p^+ = +1.6 \times 10^{-19} C$

## Mass 
1. **Proton**: $1.672 \times 10^{-27} kg$
2. **Electron**: $9.1 \times 10^{-31} kg$
3. Neutron: $1.674 \times 10^{-27} kg$

# Methods of Charging 
1. **Charging by friction**: rubbing of objects 
2. **Charging my conduction**: by contact of objects
3. **Charging by induction**: charging without contact
    - when charged object is brought near neutral conductor, it causes polarization. If grounded, the conductor gains lasting charge after disconnecting the ground. 

# Property of Electric Charge 
1. **Addivity of charge**: charges follow algebraic addition because charge is a scalar quantity. 
2. **Quantization of charge**: the net charge transferred from one body to another is always integral multiple of charge on electron. 
    - $Q = \pm ne$
    - $n = 1, 2, 3....$
3. **Conservation of charge**: total charge in an isolated system remains constant. Charges move on transfer, but cannot be created or destroyed. 

# Coulomb's Law
- According to this law, force between two charges is directly proportional to the magnitude of two charges and is inversely proportional to the square of distance between them. 

$F = k \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$

> [!NOTE]
> 1. $k = 1/4\pi\epsilon_0 = 9 \times 10^9 Nm^2C^{-2}$
> 2. $\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} N^{-1}m^{-2}C^2$

## Vector form of Coulomb's Law 
$\overrightarrow{F_{12}} = k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\cdot \hat{r_21}$

$\overrightarrow{F_{12}} = k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\cdot \frac{\overrightarrow{r_21}}{r_21}$

$\overrightarrow{F_{12}} = k \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\cdot | \overrightarrow{r_1} - \overrightarrow{r_2}|$
