    3. Number of teams in each half or quarter.
    4. Number of byes to be given in each half or quarter.
    5. Total number of rounds.
    6. Total number of matches. 

## Method of Preparing Fixture 
- Finding number of byes:
    1. Get the nearest exponent of 2 greater than the total number of teams.
    2. Subtract the total number of teams from the exponent of 2.
    3. The resulting number will the number of byes. 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- If the total number of teams can't be divided equally, 
    - **Teams in upper half**: $\frac{\text{Total number of teams} + 1}{2}$
    - **Teams in lower half**: $\frac{\text{Total number of teams} - 1}{2}$

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- **Total number of matches**: $\text{Total number of teams} - 1$
- **Number of rounds**:
    1. If number of teams is exponent of 2, it is the number of 2 present in LCM of the number of teams. 
    2. If number of teams isn't an exponent of 2, the number of rounds will be the next larger LCM of the exponent of 2 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- **Number of byes in upper half**: $\frac{NB-1}{2}$
- **Number of byes in lower half**: $\frac{NB+1}{2}$

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- **Number of matches**: $\text{Total number of teams} - 1$

## Method of Fixing Byes

1. 4 Quarters are drawn. 
2. Teams are divided equally into 4 quarters with equal number of teams. 
3. If remaining team is 1, then it is put to the first quarter. 
4. If remaining teams is 2, then they are put into quarter I and III respectively. 
5. If remaining teams is 3, then they are put to quarters I, II, and III respectively. 

## Definitions
1. **Bye**: it is special privilege given to a team in the initial rounds because of which it gets exempted from playing in the first round and directly enters the second round.

    2. Staircase Method

In this, the fixture is made in such a way that the teams are represented to cycle around which indicates the matches in each round. 

- If the number of teams is even, then the first team is fixed in the top right of the cycle and others cycle around it in clockwise direction.
- If the number of teams is odd, then one bye will be given to the team corresponding to the letter bye in the fixture which is fixed in the top right corner and the other teams cycle it in clockwise direction. 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- **Number of rounds**
    - If number of teams is even: $\text{Number of teams} - 1$
    - If number of teams is odd: equal to the number of team. 
- **Number of matches**: $\frac{\text{Number of teams}(\text{Number of teams}-1)}{2}$

- Advantages
    1. Follows a clear cycle and easy to schedule the matches.
    2. Every team competes against every other team. 
    3. Helps complete the tournament in a structured manner with minimal delays.
- Disadvantages 
    1. Becomes complex when handling large number of teams. 
    2. Some teams may get advantage due to better spacing between matches. 
    3. Fixed cycle format makes it hard for rescheduling.

## 2. Staircase Method 
In this method, fixture is made like a staircase where no team gets bye and has no problem if the number of teams is odd or even.

The matches are scheduled progressively pairing each team against every other team in a structured manner. 

- Advantages
    1. Matches are organized in a stepwire structure, make it easy to follow. 
    2. Every team plays agains every other team exactly once. 
    3. Ideal for equal participation across all teams. 
- Disadvantages
    1. With more teams, the number of rounds and matches become significant. 
    2. Teams may need byes in odd-numbered tournaments, which can disrupt scheduling. 
    3. Primarily designed for League tournament, not for knock-out style. 

## 3. Tabular Method 
This is also called the graph method. 

- Procedure:
    1. If number of teams is even, then $N+1$ squares are made vertically and horizontally where $N$ is the number of teams participating in the tournament. Else if $N$ is odd, then $N+2$ squares are made in the same manner. 
    2. Teams are categorized in a table with rows and columns and teams named as A, B, C, and so on.
        - If number of teams is even, then $N+1$ squares are made vertically and horizontally.
        - Else if the number of teams is odd, then $N+2$ squares are made vertically and horizontally.
            - Also add **bye** to the last box as the same will be given to the corresponding team on the row side in the number of round in the box. 
    3. Then the team alphabets are arranged serially on the table with the name as the row and column heading. 
    4. Make a diagonal line dividing the table into two right angled triangles. 
    5. Starting from the second team, serially write natural numbers to the last box of the row side.
    6. Then switch to next row and do the same for **non-crossed** box but it should be the next number after the one above it till it reaches the same for the last number in the first row. 
    7. Repeat till the last number is in the first box of the row. 
    8. Then write sequenced natural numbers downwards below each unfilled box below 7 except the last column. 
    9. For the last column, first write even numbers till the even number smaller than the greatest number in the first row, then switch to odd numbers. 

This procedure will give the fixture for tabular method with the boxed numbers being the round in which the teams will compete. 

# Method of Deciding the winner in League Tournament 
The team which gets the most points in a League tournament is declared the winner. Generally points are given in the follow way, 

> Winner of the match = 2 points 
> Loser of the match = 0 point 
> Draw = 1 point each 

If the points of two teams are equal, then the match is held again. But if it remains a draw, then the team which won the maximum number of matches is declared the winner. If a draw still remains, the team which scored the most goals is declared the winner. If a draw still remains, then a match is held again. Else if everything fails, the winner is declared by a toss. 

In addition to this, other methods are also used to declare the winner, 

1. British Method 
2. American Method 

## 1. British Method 
Divide the total points obtined by total points obtainable, multiplied by 100 to get the score percentage. 

$$
\frac{\text{Total points obtained}}{\text{Total possible points}} \times 100
$$

## 2. American Method 
Divide the total number of games won by total number of games played, multiplied by 100 to get winning percentage. 

$$
\text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Matches won}}{Matches played} \times 100
$$

## 2. League cum League 
All teams are divided equally into four zones and they play on a League basis. The each zonal winner competes against the other in another league tournament. Then one team becomes winner of the inter-zonal or group tournament. 

## 3. Knock-out cum League 
Teams of each zone play on knock-out basis and the winner of the four zones compete in League tournament.
