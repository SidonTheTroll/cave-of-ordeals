# Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants 

# Flower - A Fascinating Organ of Angiosperm 
Flowers are culturally significant since ancient time. They are an evolutionary marvel and sites of sexual reproduction.

# Pre-Fertilization: Structure and Events
- Hormonal and structural changes lead to differentiation and development of the flower. 
- Inflorences are formed which bear the floral buds and then the flowers. 

# Stamen, Microsporangium and Pollen Grain 
- Stamen parts 
    - Filament 
    - Anther 

Proximal end of filament is attatched to thalamus or petal of a flower. 

> [!NOTE]
> Number of petals vary depending on flower species.

Typically, angiosperm anther is bilobed with each lobe having **two theca** (dithecous). Often a longitudinal groove separating the theca. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The anther is four sided structure consisting of four microsporangia located at the corners, two in each lobe.
