## 1. List the features that make a stable biological community. 
The features that makes a stable biological community are as follows: 
1. Large and stable annual bioproductivity. 
2. Resistance to alien species invasion. 
3. Genetic and species diversity. 
4. Ecological diversity for better species habitability. 
5. Resistance to sudden changes in bioproductivity. 

## 2. Biodiversity in tropical regions is greater than the temperate and arctic regions of the world. Justify the statement. 
Biodiversity in tropical regions is greater due to climatic conditions which allows vegetation growth. This leads to more bioproduction which attracts and facilitates proliferation of animal species. As wer go towards the polar regions, these factors decrease drastically which results in less biodiversity in temperate and arctic regions. 

## 3. Why are (i) alien species invasion and (ii) loss of habitat and fragmentation considered to be the major cause of biodiversity loss? Explain with an example of each. 
1. **Alien species invasion**: when an alien species invades a region, typically there is no natural predator for it. This results in its uncontrolled population growth. Over time, it becomes the apex species and destroys the native flora and fauna which have indirectly or directly co-evolved, which results in more species being reduced in population. Eg.- introduction of rats, pigs and dogs in dodo island which resulted in extinction of the dodo bird and stoppage of germination of the dodo plant. 
2. **Loss of habitat and fragmentation**: a species is generally evolved to live in certain or specific habitats/ecosystem. If the ecosystem is destroyed, they have low chances of surviving in other regions and shows population decline. This also leads to fragmentation of the population which decreases their genetic diversity which makes them very vulnerable to new diseases. Eg.- the asiatic elephant of India have been severely displaced due to construction of human settlements which has resulted in frequent clashes between elephants and humans in the regions which used to be their traveling route. 

## 4. The genetic diversity of plants is much less than animals. How did animals acquired such genetic diversity even if plants have more population. Explain.
1. **Sexual Reproduction**: Most animals reproduce sexually, mixing genes from two parents, which creates more genetic diversity.
2. **Greater Mobility**: Animals can move to find mates in different populations, increasing gene flow and reducing inbreeding.
3. **Complex Behavior**: Animals have varied mating behaviors and selection pressures (e.g., mate choice, competition), promoting diverse genetic traits.
4. **Environmental Adaptation**: Animals adapt to diverse environments and niches, encouraging genetic variety to suit different habitats.
5. **Mutation Rates**: Animals generally have higher mutation rates due to more complex physiology, leading to increased genetic variation.
