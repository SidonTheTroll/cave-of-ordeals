## 3. What is innate immunity and how is it different from acquired immunity? 
Innate immunity is the bodyâ€™s first line of defense like skin and inflammatory responses that acts immediately against pathogens. Whereas acquired immunity is a specific, adaptive response that develops over time after exposure, providing long-lasting protection with memory cells.

## 4. What is interferon and how does it protect us? 
Interferon is a protein produced by cells in response to viral infections. It helps to protect us by signaling neighboring cells to heighten their defenses, slowing viral replication, and activating immune cells to attack infected cells.

## 5. How do polymorph nuclear lymphocytes and monocytes eliminate antigen? 
Polymorphonuclear lymphocytes and monocytes eliminate antigens by **phagocytosis**. They engulf and digest pathogens or foreign particles. They also release enzymes and reactive oxygen species to destroy these invaders and signal other immune cells to the infection site.

## 6. Give the examples of physical and physiological barrier in innate immunity? 
- **Physical Barriers**: Skin, mucous membranes, and hair in the respiratory tract.
- **Physiological Barriers**: Stomach acid, saliva, tears, and body temperature.

## 7. What is the difference between primary response and secondary response? 
The primary response is the immune system's first reaction to a new antigen, characterized by a slower, weaker response as it builds recognition. In contrast, the secondary response is faster and stronger because memory cells formed during the primary response enable a quicker reaction to the same antigen.

## 8. What are the difference classes of immunoglobulin and name the immunoglobulin responsible for allergic reactions. 
1. **IgG**: Most abundant, provides long-term immunity.
2. **IgA**: Found in mucosal areas and secretions, protects mucosal surfaces.
3. **IgM**: First antibody produced in response to infection.
4. **IgE**: Involved in allergic reactions and responses to parasites.

## 9. What do you mean by antigen binding site of immunoglobulin? 
The antigen binding site of an immunoglobulin (antibody) is the specific region where the antibody interacts with and binds to an antigen. This site is formed by the variable regions of the antibody's heavy and light chains, enabling it to uniquely recognize and neutralize specific pathogens.

## 10. What is the basic difference between humoral immune response and cell mediate immunity? 
The basic difference between humoral immune response and cell-mediated immunity is that the humoral response involves the production of antibodies by B-cells to neutralize pathogens in body fluids, while cell-mediated immunity involves T-cells that directly attack infected or abnormal cells.

## 11. With the help of example, differentiate between active immunity and passive immunity? 
| **Feature**           | **Active Immunity**                                        | **Passive Immunity**                                         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | Immunity developed by the body after exposure to an antigen or through vaccination. | Immunity acquired by receiving antibodies from another source. |
| **Example**           | Vaccination against measles, leading to long-term protection. | Receiving maternal antibodies through breast milk or an injection of antibodies (e.g., anti-venom). |
| **Duration**          | Long-lasting, often years or lifetime.                  | Short-term, typically weeks to months.                     |
| **Response Time**     | Slower initial response as the immune system develops its defenses. | Immediate protection since pre-formed antibodies are provided. |


## 12. How does vaccination improve our immunity? 
Vaccination improves our immunity by introducing a harmless form of an antigen (such as a weakened or inactivated pathogen) into the body, which stimulates the immune system to produce specific antibodies and memory cells without causing disease. This prepares the immune system for future exposure to the actual pathogen, leading to a faster and stronger immune response.

## 13. During snake bite, what type of immunity we need and why? 
During a snake bite, **passive immunity** is needed because it provides immediate protection against the venom. This is typically achieved through the administration of antivenom, which contains pre-formed antibodies that neutralize the toxins in the snake venom, helping to prevent or mitigate the harmful effects of the bite until the body can develop its own immune response.

## 14. Write down the primary and secondary lymphoid organ and what are the role of them? 
### Primary Lymphoid Organs
1. **Bone Marrow**: Site of origin and maturation for B-cells and production of blood cells, including immune cells.
2. **Thymus**: Site where T-cells mature and become immunocompetent, learning to differentiate self from non-self.

### Secondary Lymphoid Organs
1. **Lymph Nodes**: Filter lymph fluid, trap pathogens, and provide an environment for B and T-cell activation and proliferation.
2. **Spleen**: Filters blood, removes old or damaged red blood cells, and facilitates the immune response by trapping pathogens and presenting them to lymphocytes.
3. **Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT)**: Protects mucosal surfaces (e.g., gut, respiratory tract) from pathogens by producing localized immune responses. This includes structures like tonsils and Peyer's patches in the intestines.

## 15. What is MALT? 
MALT, or Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue, is a part of the immune system that protects mucosal surfaces in areas like the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. It includes structures such as Peyer's patches and tonsils, playing a vital role in initiating immune responses to pathogens that enter the body through mucosal routes.
