## 1. Why we should cut desired gene and the plasmid with same restriction endonuclease enzyme?
We use the same restriction endonuclease enzyme to cut the desired gene and plasmid to ensure compatible sticky or blunt ends, allowing them to join efficiently with ligase enzyme. 

## 2. What is the source of Taq polymerase and state its significance. 
Taq polymerase is extracted from *Thermus aquaticus*, a heat-resistant bacterium. Its significance lies in its ability to withstand high temperatures during PCR, enabling DNA replication without denaturing.

## 3. What is the role of agarose gel in gel electrophoresis? 
Agarose gel provides a semi-solid medium where smaller DNA fragments can separate from larger fragments.

## 4. What is insertional inactivation? 
Insertional inactivation is the disruption of gene's function due to the insertion of foreign DNA, which is used to identify successful cloning by antibiotic test or color change. 

## 5. How to make a host competent enough to uptake foreign DNA?
A host cell can be made to uptake foreign DNA by using enzymes to increase its cell membrane's permeability. 

## 6. Name the enzyme which helps to dissolve the cell wall of plant, bacteria and fungus. 
- **Plant**: cellulase 
- **Bacteria**: lysozyme 
- **Fungus**: chitinase

## 7. What is recombinant protein? 
Recombinant protein is a protein produced by GMO that have been inserted with a gene from another species. 

## 8. State one basic difference between exonuclease and endonuclease.
Exonuclease removes nucleotides from ends of DNA whereas endonuclease makes cuts at specific position within the DNA. 

## 9. Write the function of the following pBR322 vector- ROP, AmpR, BamH1.
- **ROP**: codes for proteins involved in replication of plasmid. 
- **ampR**: codes for antibiotic resistant genes. 
- **BamH1**: codes for tetracycline resistant gene. 

## 10. Write the unique features of agrobacterium. 
1. It has been modified into cloning vector. 
2. It is more pathogenic to plants. 
3. Able to deliver the gene of interest to variety of plants.
