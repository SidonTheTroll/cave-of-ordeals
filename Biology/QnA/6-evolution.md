### 1. What is Hardy-Weinberg Principle and how it can be altered? 
The Hardy-Weinberg Principle states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population remain constant from generation to generation, provided no evolutionary influences (like mutations, selection, or genetic drift) are acting. 

It can be altered by factors such as:
1. **Mutation**: Introducing new genetic variations.
2. **Natural selection**: Favoring certain alleles over others.
3. **Genetic drift**: Random changes in allele frequencies, especially in small populations.
4. **Gene flow**: Migration of individuals between populations.
5. **Non-random mating**: Preferential mating altering genotype frequencies.

### 2. Write down the hypothesis put forward by Oparin and Haldane.
The **Oparin-Haldane Hypothesis** suggests that life on Earth arose gradually from non-living matter through a process called **chemical evolution**. The key points are:

1. **Prebiotic Earth Conditions**: The Earth's early atmosphere, rich in gases like methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water vapor, was reducing (lacked oxygen), creating a favorable environment for organic molecules to form.

2. **Formation of Organic Compounds**: Energy sources like lightning or UV radiation facilitated chemical reactions, leading to the formation of simple organic molecules, such as amino acids and nucleotides.

3. **Development of Complex Molecules**: These simple organic molecules accumulated in the "primordial soup" (oceans) and gradually combined to form more complex molecules, like proteins and nucleic acids, which eventually led to the formation of the first primitive cells.

### 3. What are the two key concept of Darwinian Theory of Evolution? 
The two key concepts of Darwin's Theory of Evolution are:

1. **Natural Selection**: Organisms with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, these advantageous traits become more common in the population.

2. **Descent with Modification**: Species change over generations, with new traits emerging and accumulating through reproduction. Over long periods, this can lead to the formation of new species.

### 4. State the theory proposed by Hugo de Vries. 
Hugo de Vries proposed the **Mutation Theory** of evolution or **Saltation**. According to this theory:

1. **Mutations** are sudden, random changes in an organism's genetic material, leading to new traits.
2. These mutations provide the raw material for evolution and can produce new species in a relatively short period of time, as opposed to the gradual changes suggested by Darwin.

De Vries believed that evolution occurs primarily through these significant and abrupt changes rather than through the slow accumulation of small variations.

### 5. What are divergent and convergent evolution? 
**Divergent Evolution** occurs when two or more species sharing a common ancestor evolve different traits over time, typically due to different environmental pressures or ecological niches. This leads to increased differences between the species. An example is the evolution of the forelimbs of mammals, like the wings of bats and the flippers of whales, which serve different functions but share a common origin.

**Convergent Evolution** is when unrelated species evolve similar traits independently, often because they occupy similar environments or face similar selective pressures. An example is the streamlined bodies of dolphins (mammals) and sharks (fish), which evolved separately but are both adapted for efficient swimming.

### 6. What are Homologous and Analogous organ? Give one example from plant and animal. 
**Homologous Organs** are structures in different species that have a common evolutionary origin but may perform different functions. They arise due to divergent evolution.
- **Animal Example**: The forelimbs of a human (used for manipulation) and a bat's wing (used for flying).
- **Plant Example**: The leaves of a cactus (spines for protection) and the leaves of a peepal tree (used for photosynthesis).

**Analogous Organs** are structures in different species that perform similar functions but do not have a common evolutionary origin. They arise due to convergent evolution.
- **Animal Example**: The wings of a butterfly (an insect) and the wings of a bird (a vertebrate).
- **Plant Example**: The tendrils of pea plants (modified leaves) and the tendrils of grapevines (modified stems), both used for climbing but with different origins.

### 7. State the differences between theories of Darwin and Hugo de Vries. 
| Aspect | Darwin's Theory | De Vries's Mutation Theory |
|-|-|-|
| **Mechanism of Evolution** | Natural Selection | Mutation |
| **Rate of Evolution**| Gradual, slow process | Rapid, sudden changes |
| **Role of Variation** | Gradual and continuous | Discrete and abrupt changes |
| **Source of Genetic Variation** | Small incremental changes | Sudden genetic mutations |

### 8. Who discarded the theory of spontaneous generation? 
Louis Pasteur discarded the theory of spontaneous generation through his experiments in the 19th century. By using swan-neck flasks, he demonstrated that microorganisms did not arise spontaneously but were introduced from the environment. His work provided crucial evidence against spontaneous generation and supported the germ theory of disease.

### 9. How human action can lead to evolution? 
Human actions can drive evolution through processes like **artificial selection** and **genetic modification**. 

- **Artificial Selection**: Humans selectively breed plants and animals for desired traits, accelerating evolution by favoring specific characteristics, such as increased crop yields or domesticated animals with particular features.
- **Genetic Modification**: Humans can directly alter the genetic makeup of organisms through genetic engineering, introducing new traits or enhancing existing ones.

Additionally, human activities like **habitat destruction** and **climate change** can create new selective pressures, leading to evolutionary changes in affected species.

| Feature | *Homo erectus* | *Homo habilis* |
|-|-|-|
| **Time Period** | Approximately 1.9 million to 110,000 years ago | Approximately 2.4 to 1.4 million years ago |
| **Cranial Capacity (Brain Capacity)** | Larger, around 900 cc | Smaller, about 650-800 cc |
| **Body Size** | More modern, similar to modern humans | Smaller, more ape-like |
| **Tool Use** | Advanced tools, including handaxes | Basic tools, primarily core tools |
| **Posture and Bipedalism** | Fully bipedal with a more human-like posture | Bipedal but with more ape-like features |
| **Habitat** | Adapted to a variety of environments, including open savannahs | Primarily forested and wooded areas |
| **Food habit** | Probably ate meat | Ate essentially fruit. |

2. **Jawless fish**: 350 mya 
3. **Seaweeds**: 320 mya 
4. **Dryopithecus**: 12-9 mya 
5. **Ramapithecus**: 12-8 mya
6. **Australopithecines**: About 2 mya
7. **Neanderthal man**: 100,000-40,000 years ago 

### 12. What is genetic drift? 
**Genetic drift** is a mechanism of evolution that refers to random changes in the frequency of alleles (gene variants) in a population over time. Unlike natural selection, which involves favorable traits becoming more common due to survival advantages, genetic drift occurs by chance, especially in small populations.

Two key forms of genetic drift are:
1. **Bottleneck Effect**: A drastic reduction in population size (due to events like natural disasters) leads to a loss of genetic variation and random changes in allele frequencies.
2. **Founder Effect**: When a small group from a population migrates to a new area and establishes a new population, random allele frequencies in this group may differ from the original population.

Genetic drift can lead to the fixation or loss of alleles, significantly impacting genetic diversity.

### 13. What was the first mammal on the earth? 
The first mammals on Earth were small, shrew-like creatures that appeared during the **Late Triassic period**, around 225 million years ago. One of the earliest known mammals is **Morganucodon**, a small, nocturnal insectivore that lived alongside the dinosaurs. These early mammals were likely warm-blooded, had fur, and laid eggs, similar to modern-day monotremes like the platypus. Over time, mammals evolved and diversified, leading to the wide variety of species we see today.

### 14. What was the ancestor of modern-day plants? 
The ancestors of modern-day plants evolved in a sequence, starting with **Rhynia-type plants** (~400 million years ago), simple spore-producing vascular plants. This was followed by **Psilophyton**, more complex spore-bearing plants with branching. Next came **Progymnosperms**, which had wood and advanced vascular systems but still reproduced via spores. Finally, **Seed ferns** (~360â€“250 million years ago) emerged, marking the transition to seed reproduction, leading toward modern gymnosperms and angiosperms.

### 15. When did the first cellular form of life appear? 
About 2000 mya, first cellular form of life appeared on earth.
