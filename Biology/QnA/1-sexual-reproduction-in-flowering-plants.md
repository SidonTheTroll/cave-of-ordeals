#### Explain the structure of megasporangium of ovule. 
The megasporangium or ovule is a small structure attached to the placenta via. a stalk called funicle. 

#### Define megasporogenesis. 

#### Q/ Explain the development of female gametophyte or embryo sac in angiosperm. 
1. **Megasporogenesis**: This is the initial stage where a single **megaspore mother cell** undergoes meiotic division, resulting in the formation of four megaspores. 
2. **Monosporic development**: Typically, only one of the four megaspores survives and becomes the **functional megaspore**, while the other three disintegrate. This functional megaspore develops into the female gametophyte. 
3. **Formation of the embryo sac**: The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically to form two nuclei, which move to opposite poles, resulting in the formation of a **2-nucleate** embryo sac. Subsequently, mitotic divisions lead to the formation of **4-nucleate** and later **8-nucleate** stages of the embryo sac. 
4. **Organization of the female gametophyte**: Following the **8-nucleate** stage, cell walls are laid down, leading to the organization of the **female gametophyte** or **embryo sac**. Six of the eight nuclei become surrounded by cell walls and organized into cells, while the remaining two nuclei, called **polar nuclei**, move to the large **central cell**. 
5. **Cell distribution within the embryo sac**: The embryo sac exhibits a characteristic cell distribution. At the micropylar end, three cells constitute the **egg apparatus**, which includes **two synergids** and **one egg cell**. The synergids have **special cellular thickening** called **filiform apparatus**, which guides pollen tubes into the synergids. At the chalazal end, three cells called antipodals are present. The large **central cell** contains two **polar nuclei**.  

#### Q/ What do you understand by double fertilization and triple fusion? 
> **Double Fertilization**  
> - It involves the fusion of two sperm (pollen) cells with two different nuclei within the embryo sac of the ovule. 
> - One pollen cell fertilizaes the egg cell, forming the zygote (2n) which develops into the embryo. 
> - The other pollen cell fuses with two polar nuclei, resulting in the formation of triploid (3n) cell called the priamry endosperm nucleus. 
> - The zygote and the primary endosperm nucleus together constitute double fertilization. 
>
> **Triple Fusion**
> - Triple fusion specially refers to the fusion of one sperm cell with two polar nuclei within the central cell of the  embryo sac. 
> - This fusion resultsin the formation of primary endosperm nucleus, which is triploid (3n), as it contains the genetic material from both the sperm cell (haploid) and two polar nuclei (haploid each). 
> - The primary endosperm nuncleus is central to the formation of endosperm tissue, which serves as a source of nutrition for the developing embryo. 
> - Triple fusion occurs as a part of double fertilization, where one sperm cell fertilizes the egg cell (forming the zygote) and other sperm cell participates in triple fusion with the polar nuclei.
