            - Four sided structure 
            - Consists of four microsporangia located at corner 
        - Microsporangia develop into pollen sac 
            - Contain pollen grains 

# Structure of Microsporangia
- Surrounded by four wall layer 
    - Epidermis, Endothecium, Middle Layer, Tapetum

- Eah one is potential **pollen** or **microspore mother cell**
- The process of formation of microspore from pollen mothes cell through **meiosis** is called **microsporogenesis**.
- Anther 
    - Mature and dehydrated 
    - Microspore dissociate from each other and develop into pollen grain.

- Members of **Rosaceae, leguminoseae and solanaceae** can last for months. 
- Pollen can be stored for a long time in **Pollen Banks** by preserving them in **liquid nitrogen** (-196 $\degree C$)

# Female Reproductive Organ 
- Pistil or carpel has **3 parts**
    1. **Stigma:** landing platform for pollen gain 
    2. **Style:** slender part beneath the stigma 
    3. **Ovary:** basal bulged part of pistil 
        - Cavity is present in the ovule called **Ovarian Cavity**
        - **Placenta** is located inside ovarian cavity 
        - **Ovule** arise from placenta 
        - Number of ovule 
            - **One ovule** in wheat, paddy, mango, etc. 
            - **Many ovule** in papaya, watermelon, orchid, etc. 
- Number of pistils:
    1. **Single pistil:** monocarpellary 
    2. **Multiple pistil:** multicarpellary 
        - **Fused:** syncarpous, eg., papaver 
        - **Free:** apocarpous, eg., michelia 

## The Ovule or Megasporangium 
- Ovule is small structure attached to placenta by means of stalk - **Funicle**
- **Hilum:** The point of attachment of funicle with ovule
- **Integument:** one or two protective envelope that are present in ovule 
- **Nucellus:** abundant food reserve enclosed within Integument of mass cell 
- Integument encircles nucellus except at a small opening called **micropyle**. 
    - Opposite to micropyle is **Chalazal end**. 
- **Embryo sac (female gametophyte):** present inside nucellus 
    - Ovule has single embryo sac from megaspore

## Megasporogenesis 
It is the process of formation of megaspore from megaspore mothes cell. 

- One of nucellular cell at micropylar end differentiate and become **megaspore mother cells (2n)**, with *dense cytoplasm and prominent nucleus* 
    - MMC undergo **meiosis** and forms **four megaspore (n)**, called *megaspore tetrad* 

## Female Gametophyte 
- Majority of flower plants have **one megaspore functional and other three degenerate**. 
    - Functional megaspore: **free nuclear division**
        - Mitosis: 2 nucleate, 4 nucleate and later 8 nucleate embryo
- Functional megaspore develop into **Female gametophyte (embryo sac)** 
- **Monosporic development:** embryo sac from single megaspore 
- **6 out of 8 nuclei** surround themselves with **cell wall** 
- Remaining 2 nuclei form **Polar nuclei in large central cell**. 

## Embyro Sac 
- 3 cells are present at micropylar end 
    1. 1 Egg apparatus 
    2. 2 synergids 
        - Synergids are cellular thickening present at micropylar end. 
        - Later form **filiform apparatus** to guide pollen tube in synergid 
- 3 cells are present at chalazal end called **Antipodal cells** 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- Embryo sac: 
    - 8 nucleate 
    - 7 celled

# Pollination 
It is the process of transfer of pollen grains from anther to stigma of a flower. It is of three types 

1. Autogamy 
2. Geitonogamy 
3. Xenogamy 

## Autogamy 
It is the transfer of pollen grain from the anther to stigma of the same flower. 

- In normal flower: 
    - Open and exposis the anther and stigma 
    - Complete autogamy is rare 

- Requirements: 
    - Synchrony in pollen release and stigma respectively 
    Anther and stigma should lie close to each other. 

- Here three flowers are taken which show two types of flowers: 
    - Viola, Oxalis, Commelina 
    - Types of flower: 
        1. **Chasmogamous:** Exposed anther and stigma 
        2. **Cleistogamous:** 
            - Don't open at all 
            - Anther and stigma lie close to each other 
            - When anther dehisce in flower bud, pollen grain come in contact with stigma to effect pollination. 
            - Invariabily autogamous and no chance of cross pollination. 
            - Assured seed set even in absence of pollinator. 

## Geitonogamy 
- Transfer of pollen grain from the anther to stigma of another flower in the same plant. 
- Involve pollinating agent 
- Functionally cross pollination 
- Genetically similar to autogamy 

## Xenogamy 
- Transfer of pollen grain from anther to stigma of another flower on different plant. 
- Genetically different pollen grain is transferred to stigma. 

# Agents of Pollination 
- Plants use two abiotic and one biotic agents: 
    - Abiotic: **wind and water**
    - Biotic: **animals** 

> [!NOTE]
> Majority of plants use biotic agent 

## Anemophily (Wind pollination)
- Pollen grain are **light and non-sticky**
- Well exposed stamena and large often feathery stigma to trap pollen grain. Eg., corn cob 
- Common in grass 
- In flower, 
    - Single ovule in ovary 
    - Numerous flowers packed in inflorescence. 

## Hydrophily (Water Pollination)
- It is rare and limited to **30 genra** of **monocotyledons**, eg., *Valllisneria* and *Hydrilla* for freshwater and *Zostera* (marine sea grass)
- Water hyacinth and water lily can be mistaken for hydrophilous but their flower is present above water and pollinated by incect or wind. 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- ***Vallisneria***: 
    - Female flower reaches surface of waetr by long stalk. 
    - Male flower are present underwater from where they detach and float on the surface to release pollen. 
    - Pollend are also carried by water current. 
- ***Seagrass***:
    - Female flower is submerged in water 
    - Pollen grains are released inside the water 
        - The grains are long and ribbon like which help them go with water current. 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- Most water pollinated species have a **mucilagenous covering** in the **pollen grain** to protect it from wetting.

## Zoophily (Animal Pollination)
- Animals are pollinating agent 
    - Common pollinating agent: bees, butterflies, flies, beetles, wasp, ant, moth, bird, bat 
    - Large animals: primate (lemur), arboreal (tree dwelling rodents) or reptiles (gecko lizard, garden lizard)
- Flowers: large, colorful, fragrent, rich in nectar. 
    - If small, flowers are clustered in inflorescence 
- Flower provides **floral rewards** to the animals that visit them in the form of **nectar and pollen grain** 
- **Special floral rewards:** safe place to lay eggs, eg., amorphophallus 
- Species of moth deposit egg in locule of ovary in **Yucca plant** which in turn gets pollinated. 
    - Larvae of moth comes out before seed development. 
- Many insect consume pollen and nectar without pollinating. These are called **Pollen/Nectar robbers** 

# Outbreeding Device 
- Majority of flowering plants are **bisexual** 
- Continious self pollinating leads to **inbreeding depression** 
- Thesefore plants develop many devices to discourage self polliantion and encourage cross pollination which called **Outbreeding device** 

1. In some plant species pollen release and stigma receptivity aren't synchronized. 
2. Anther and stigma are placed at different position so pollen cannot come in contact with stigma of same flower. 
3. **Self incompatibility** prevents pollen germination in pistil of the same flower. 
4. Some plants produce **unisexual flowers** 
    - Same plant has both male and female flower: **monoecious**, eg., castor, maize
    - Male and female flower are present in different plants: **dioecious**, eg., papya 

# Pollen Pistil Interaction
- Pollination doesn't guarantee transfer of right type of pollen. 
    - Rejected pollen from different species or same plant (**self-incompatibilty**)
    - Accepted if the above aren't present. 
- Pollen grain germinate to produce pollen tube. 
- Pollen tube grow through stigma, style and reach ovary. 
- Pollen tube carries **2 male gamete**. 
- Pollen tube enter ovule through **micropyle**. 
- Enters one of the synergids through **filiform apparatus***. 

# Artificial Hybridization 
- Major approach for crop improvement programme. 
- In such crossing experiments, desired pollen grain are used and stigma is protected from contamination. 

- It has two techniques, 
    1. **Emasculation**
        - For bisexual flowers 
        - Removal of anther from flower bud 
        - It is done before anther dehisces
        - Eliminates the chance of self-pollination 
    2. **Bagging**
        - Done for both bisexual and unisexual flowers. 
        - Done in bisexual flowers after emasculation
        - Flowers is covered with butter paper or polythene 
        - Prevents contamination of stigma with unwanted pollen 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

1. When stigma is receptive, the flower is unbagged 
2. Matured pollen are dusted and flower is bagged again. 
3. Fruit it allowed to develop. 

# Double Fertilization 
- After entering one of the synergids, pollen tube release two male gametes in cytoplasm of synergid. 
- One male gamete moves towards egg cell and forms zygote (2n)
    - After this, **synergids degenerate**, which is called **syngamy** 
- Other male gamete fuses with **2 polar nuclei** and forms **Primary endosperm nucleus** (3n), which is called **triple fusion**. 
Syngamy and triple fusion take place in embryo sac so it called **double fertilization** 
- Antipodal cells also degenerate during this time. 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- Central cell becomes **primary endosperm cell** and later developes into **endosperm** 
- Zygote develop into embryo. 

# Post Fertilization Events 
This category include endosperm and embryo development, maturation of ovule into seed and ovary into fruit. 

- Endosperm 
    - Develops before embryo development to provide nourishment to developing embryo. 
    - Primary endosperm divides mitotically to form **triploid endosperm tissue**which is filledwith reserve food material. 

- Types of endosperm 
    1. Free nuclear endosperm 
        - Most common 
        - Primary endosperm nucleus performs successive nuclear division and forms free nuclei. 
        - Eg., coconut water
    2. Cellular endosperm 
        - Cell wall formation occurs around free nuclei 
        - Endosperm becomes cellular 
        - Eg,. white kernel in coconut 

# Embryo 
- Develops at the micropylar end of enbryo sac 
- Most zygote start development only after some amount of endosperm is formed to assure nutrition to developing embryo. 
- **Embryogeny**: early stage of embryo development and similar in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons
- Zygote gives rise to **proembryo** subsequently **globular, heart shaped and mature embryo**  

## Dicotyledonous Embyro 
- Consists of an embryonal axis and two cotyledon 
- **Epicotyl:** Portion of embryonal axis is above cotyledon 
- **Plumule or stem tip**: terminal part of Epicotyl
- **Hypocotyl:** cylindrical portion below level of cotyledons 
- **Radicle or Root tip**: terminal part of hypocotyl, covered by root cap. 

## Monocotyledonous Embryo 
- Possesses only one cotyledon 
- In grass family, the cotyledon is called **scutellum** which is situated on one side (lateral) of embryonal axis. 
- At lower end of embryonal axis has radicle and the root cap enclosed in an undifferentiated sheath called **coleorhiza** 
- **Epicotyl:** portion of embryonal axis above level of attachment of scutellum. 
- Epicotyl has a shoot apex or plumule enclosed in hollow foliar structure called **Coleoptile** 

# Seed 
- Final product of sexual reproduction
- A typical seed consists of **seed coat, cotyledon and an embryo axis**. 
- Cotyledon is thick and swollen due to storage of food reserve as in legumes. 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- Seeds are of two types 
    1. Non-albuminous or Ex-albuminous Seeds
        - No residue endosperm 
        - Completely consumed during embryonic development. Eg., pea, beann, groundnut.
    2. Albuminous seeds: 
        - Retains some part of endosperm that is not completely consumed during embryonic development. Eg., wheat, maize, barley, castor. 
- In some seeds, remnants of nucellus persists which is called **perisperm**. Eg., black pepper, beet. 
- Integument of ovule hardens as tough protective seed coat. 
- Micropyle remains as small pore in the seed coat. This facilitates entry of oxygen and water into seed guring germination.
- As seed matures, water content is reduced and seed becomes relatively dry (10-15% moisture by mass) 
- Metabolic activity of embryo slows down 
- Embryo may enter a state of inactivity called **dormancy** 
- If favourable condition is available (moiture, oxygen and suitable temperature), the germinate.

# Fruit 
- Feritilized or ripened ovary is called fruit. 
- Transformation of ovules into seeds and ovary into fruit simultaneously.
- The wall of ovary develop into wall of fruit, i.e., pericarp. 
- The fruit can be fleshy as guava, orange and mango and may be dry such as groundnut and mustrad. 
- Most fruit develop from ovary which are called **True fruit**, i.e., mango. 
- In apple, strawberry and cashew, **thallamus** contribute in fruit formation which are called **false fruit**. 

## Parthenocarpy 
- In few species, fruit develops without fertilization called **parthenocarpic fruits**. Eg., banana.
- Parthenocary is induced through application of **growth hormones** 
    - Such fruits are seedless. 

# Apomixis 
- It is a type of **asexual reproduction** which mimics sexual reproduction. 
- Seeds are produced without fertilization.
- Very common in ***Asteraceae*** and **grasses**. 
- In some species, **diploid egg cells** is formed **without meiosis** and develops into seed without fertilization.
- In citrus and mango, nucellular cell surrounding the embyro sac start dividing, protude into embryo sac and develop into embryo. 
- Occurance of more than one embryo in seed is called **polyembryony**.
