# Male Reproductive Organ (Stamen)
- **Stamen**
    1. **Filament**: long and slender stalk 
        - **Proximal end*** attached to **Thalamus or petal**
    2. **Anther**
        - Terminal 
        - Bilobed structure 
        - Each lobe has two theca - **dithecous**
        - Longitudinal groove separate theca 
        - Anther
            - Four sided structure 
            - Consists of four microsporangia located at corner 
        - Microsporangia develop into pollen sac 
            - Contain pollen grains 

# Structure of Microsporangia
- Surrounded by four wall layer 
    - Epidermis, Endothecium, Middle Layer, Tapetum 
- Outer three layers for protection and helps in dehiscence of anther 
- Inner-most wall layer - **Tapetum**
    - Nourishes developing pollen grain 
    - Dense cytoplasm and more than one nucleus 
- Young anther 
    - Center of microsporangium 
    - Homogeneous cells: **Sporogenous tissue** 
    - Some **sporogenous tissue** can undergo **meiosis** and are called **microspore mother cell**

# Microsporogenesis
Each cell of sporogenous tissue is capable to giving rise to **microspore tetrad**.

- Eah one is potential **pollen** or **microspore mother cell**
- The process of formation of microspore from pollen mothes cell through **meiosis** is called **microsporogenesis**.
- Anther 
    - Mature and dehydrated 
    - Microspore dissociate from each other and develop into pollen grain. 
    - Released with dehiscence of anther. 

# Pollen Grain 
- Male Gametophyte 
- Spherical: 25-50 micrometer in diameter 
- 2 layers 
    - **Exine**
        - Outer most layer 
        - Made of **sporopollenin**: most resistant organic material 
        - Withstand high temperature, acid and alkali.
        - No enzyme can degrade it 
        - Exine has prominant aperture called **Germ Pore** where sporopollenin is absent.
            - Used by **intine** to **develop pollen tube**.
    - **Intine**
        - Inner wall 
        - Thin and contineous layer of **cellulose** and **pectin** 
        - Cytoplasm of pollen grain is surrounded by **plasma membrane**

## Matured Pollen Grain 
- Divides into two cells 
    - **Vegetative cell**
        - Bigger, abundant food reserve 
        - Irregular shaped nucleus 
    - **Generative cell**
        - Floats in cytoplasm of vegetative cell
        - Spindle shaped
        - Dense cytoplasm

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- Angiosperm
    - 60%: pollen shed at 2 cell stage 
    - 40%: pollen shed at 3 cell stage 
        - Generative cell mitotically divide 
            - 2 Male gametes 

## Other Pollen Facts and uses 
1. **Parthenium** or **carrot grass** cause pollen allergy due the allergens, **parthenin**and other chemicals. 
    - Contaminant with imported wheat 
2. Pollen Grains are rich in **nutrients** 
    - Used as supplements in the form of **pollen tablet and syrup** 
    - Increase performance of athletes and race horses. 

## Pollen Viability
- It is a period when pollen retains ability to germinate when it lands on stigma.
- Some cereal like **rice and wheat** lose viability in **30 minutes**
- Members of **Rosaceae, leguminoseae and solanaceae** can last for months. 
- Pollen can be stored for a long time in **Pollen Banks** by preserving them in **liquid nitrogen** (-196 $\degree C$)

# Female Reproductive Organ 
- Pistil or carpel has **3 parts**
    1. **Stigma:** landing platform for pollen gain 
    2. **Style:** slender part beneath the stigma 
    3. **Ovary:** basal bulged part of pistil 
        - Cavity is present in the ovule called **Ovarian Cavity**
        - **Placenta** is located inside ovarian cavity 
        - **Ovule** arise from placenta 
        - Number of ovule 
            - **One ovule** in wheat, paddy, mango, etc. 
            - **Many ovule** in papaya, watermelon, orchid, etc. 
- Number of pistils:
    1. **Single pistil:** monocarpellary 
    2. **Multiple pistil:** multicarpellary 
        - **Fused:** syncarpous, eg., papaver 
        - **Free:** apocarpous, eg., michelia 

## The Ovule or Megasporangium 
- Ovule is small structure attached to placenta by means of stalk - **Funicle**
- **Hilum:** The point of attachment of funicle with ovule
- **Integument:** one or two protective envelope that are present in ovule 
- **Nucellus:** abundant food reserve enclosed within Integument of mass cell 
- Integument encircles nucellus except at a small opening called **micropyle**. 
    - Opposite to micropyle is **Chalazal end**. 
- **Embryo sac (female gametophyte):** present inside nucellus 
    - Ovule has single embryo sac from megaspore

## Megasporogenesis 
It is the process of formation of megaspore from megaspore mothes cell. 

- One of nucellular cell at micropylar end differentiate and become **megaspore mother cells (2n)**, with *dense cytoplasm and prominent nucleus* 
    - MMC undergo **meiosis** and forms **four megaspore (n)**, called *megaspore tetrad* 

## Female Gametophyte 
- Majority of flower plants have **one megaspore functional and other three degenerate**. 
    - Functional megaspore: **free nuclear division**
        - Mitosis: 2 nucleate, 4 nucleate and later 8 nucleate embryo
- Functional megaspore develop into **Female gametophyte (embryo sac)** 
- **Monosporic development:** embryo sac from single megaspore 
- **6 out of 8 nuclei** surround themselves with **cell wall** 
- Remaining 2 nuclei form **Polar nuclei in large central cell**. 

## Embyro Sac 
- 3 cells are present at micropylar end 
    1. 1 Egg apparatus 
    2. 2 synergids 
        - Synergids are cellular thickening present at micropylar end. 
        - Later form **filiform apparatus** to guide pollen tube in synergid 
- 3 cells are present at chalazal end called **Antipodal cells**

- Embryo sac: 
    - 8 nucleate 
    - 7 celled

# Pollination 
It is the process of transfer of pollen grains from anther to stigma of a flower. It is of three types 

1. Autogamy 
2. Geitonogamy 
3. Xenogamy 

## Autogamy 
It is the transfer of pollen grain from the anther to stigma of the same flower. 

- In normal flower: 
    - Open and exposis the anther and stigma 
    - Complete autogamy is rare 

- Requirements: 
    - Synchrony in pollen release and stigma respectively 
    Anther and stigma should lie close to each other. 

- Here three flowers are taken which show two types of flowers: 
    - Viola, Oxalis, Commelina 
    - Types of flower: 
        1. **Chasmogamous:** Exposed anther and stigma 
        2. **Cleistogamous:** 
            - Don't open at all 
            - Anther and stigma lie close to each other 
            - When anther dehisce in flower bud, pollen grain come in contact with stigma to effect pollination. 
            - Invariabily autogamous and no chance of cross pollination. 
            - Assured seed set even in absence of pollinator. 

## Geitonogamy 
- Transfer of pollen grain from the anther to stigma of another flower in the same plant. 
- Involve pollinating agent 
- Functionally cross pollination 
- Genetically similar to autogamy 

## Xenogamy 
- Transfer of pollen grain from anther to stigma of another flower on different plant. 
- Genetically different pollen grain is transferred to stigma. 

# Agents of Pollination 
- Plants use two abiotic and one biotic agents: 
    - Abiotic: **wind and water**
    - Biotic: **animals** 

> [!NOTE]
> Majority of plants use biotic agent 

## Anemophily (Wind pollination)
- Pollen grain are **light and non-sticky**
- Well exposed stamena and large often feathery stigma to trap pollen grain. Eg., corn cob 
- Common in grass 
- In flower, 
    - Single ovule in ovary 
    - Numerous flowers packed in inflorescence. 

## Hydrophily (Water Pollination)
- It is rare and limited to **30 genra** of **monocotyledons**, eg., *Valllisneria* and *Hydrilla* for freshwater and *Zostera* (marine sea grass)
- Water hyacinth and water lily can be mistaken for hydrophilous but their flower is present above water and pollinated by incect or wind. 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- ***Vallisneria***: 
    - Female flower reaches surface of waetr by long stalk. 
    - Male flower are present underwater from where they detach and float on the surface to release pollen. 
    - Pollend are also carried by water current. 
- ***Seagrass***:
    - Female flower is submerged in water 
    - Pollen grains are released inside the water 
        - The grains are long and ribbon like which help them go with water current. 

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

- Most water pollinated species have a **mucilagenous covering** in the **pollen grain** to protect it from wetting.
