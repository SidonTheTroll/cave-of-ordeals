# Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants 

- Reproduction
    1. **Sexual**: two parents
    2. **Asexual**: one parent 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Progeny of sexual reproduction is not completely silimar to a singular parent because of combination of characters.

> [!NOTE]
> For smoe generation, there's no variation in asexual organisms.  
> Sometimes, environmental factors leads to variations.

- Sexual reproduction helps species to adapt. 

> [!TIP] Note
>  Inbreeding leads to abnormalities after some generation and is called **inbreeding depression**. 

- Some plants are seasonal to adjust to light intensity and temperature.
