# Reproductive Health 
- **Definition**: according to WHO, reproductive health means total well-being in all aspects of reproduction, i.e., physical, emotional, behavioral and social. Therefore, a society with people having physically and functionally normal reproductive organs and normal emotional and behavioral interactions among them in all sex-related aspects might be called reproductive health. 

> [!NOTE]
> Maintaining reproductive health is significant because it ensures the overall well-being, prevention of > diseases, and the ability to have healthy pregnancies and births. Methods to achieve it include:
> 
> 1. **Education and Awareness:** Providing information on sexual health, contraception, and safe practices.
> 2. **Access to Healthcare:** Regular check-ups, screenings, and access to family planning services.
> 3. **Vaccinations:** Protecting against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), like HPV.
> 4. **Healthy Lifestyle:** Balanced diet, exercise, and avoiding harmful substances.
> 5. **Support Services:** Counseling and mental health support for reproductive issues.
> 
> These efforts collectively help in promoting reproductive health and preventing related complications.

# Reproductive Health - Problems and Strategies 
- India was one of the first countries to initiate action plans and programs at a national level to attain total reproductive health as a social goal. 
- These programs called **'family planning'** were initiated in 1951 by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru and were periodically assessed over the past decades.

## Notes on Natural Contraceptive Methods
### Principle:
- Natural methods work by avoiding the meeting of ovum and sperm.

### Methods:
1. **Periodic Abstinence:**
   - Couples abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of the menstrual cycle (fertile period).
   - Prevents conception by avoiding intercourse during the time when ovulation is likely.

2. **Withdrawal (Coitus Interruptus):**
   - Male partner withdraws penis from vagina before ejaculation.
   - Prevents insemination.

3. **Lactational Amenorrhea:**
   - Based on the absence of ovulation during intense lactation post-parturition.
   - Effective while the mother fully breastfeeds, typically up to six months.

### Advantages:
- No use of medicines or devices.
- Minimal side effects.

### Disadvantages:
- High chances of failure.

## Barrier Contraceptive Methods
