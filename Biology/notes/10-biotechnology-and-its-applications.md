# Biotechnology and its Applications 

# Gene Therapy 
- Replace faulty gene with functional gene 
    - But not for all cases 
        - As it is not easy to reach every cell and cure disease. 

## ADA Deficiency Disease
It is a condition when the absence of an enzyme leads to decreased immunity. 

- Correction to ADA Deficiency Disease
    1. **Bone Marrow Transplantation (Temporary)**: the bone marrow from a healthy individual is taken out and implanted to the recipient that causes the person to get the ability to make normal lymphocytes. 
    2. **Inject ADA (Temporary)**: ADA is produced artificially and directly injected into the patient directly. But soon runs out and requires another dose. 
    3. **Lymphocyte Transplant (Temporary)**: The healthy Lymphocytes are taken out from the patient and with the help of bacteriophage complementary DNA, ADH is inserted into the lymphocyte that gives the temporary ability to produce ADA. But as cells die after some time, the process needs to be repeated again. 
    4. **Gene Therapy (Permanent)**: With the help of Amniocentesis, defects are detected in the early embryonic stage and is given gene therapy with the help of r-DNA technology which integrates with the foetus's DNA and solves the defect. 

# Transgenic Animals 
Transgenic animals are organisms whose genome has been intentionally modified by the introduction of one or more foreign DNA sequences from another species, especially human DNA for research purposes. 

- Uses of Transgenic Animals 
    1. **Vaccine safety**: to test the viability and safety of prototype vaccines.
    2. **Chemical safety**: to test the safety of chemical dosage combination. 
    3. **Study of diseases**: to test the symptoms of diseases on human body. 

An example of useful transgenic animal was Rosy the cow which produces more nutritional milk due to the presence of 2.4 g per liter human alpha-lactalbumin in the milk. 

# Ethical Issues
## GEAC 
- Stands for **Genetic Engineering Approval Committee**
It is an organization set up by the Indian government that makes user all Genetic Modification research are done safely and for the betterment of humanity.
