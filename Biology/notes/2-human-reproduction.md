# Human Reproduction 

- Humans are **viviparous** 

> [!NOTE]
> - Important events in human reproduction
>   1. **Gametogenesis**: formation of gametes 
>   2. **Insemination**: transfer of sperms to the female genital tract
>   3. **Fertilization**: fusion of male and female gametes
>   4. **Implantation**: formation and development of blastocyst and its attatchment to the uterine wall
>   5. **Gestation**: period of embryonic development 
>   6. **Parturition**: delivery of the baby

> [!TIP]
> Male continues to develop sperms till very old age but females stop ovulating aronud the age of 50. 

# Male Reproductive System 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Characteristics** 
>   1. Located in the pelvic region 
>   2. Includes: pair of testis, accessory ducts, glands and external genitalia. 
>   3. Testis are situated outside the abdominal cavity within a pouch called scrotum. 
>       - Helps to maintain temperature for spermatogenesis (2-2.5$\degree C$ lower than body temperature)
>   4. **Testis**:
>       1. Oval in shape
>       2. **Length**: 4-5 cm 
>       3. **Width**: 2-3 cm 
>   5. Testis is covered by a thick covering 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Testis**
>   - Has about 250 compartments each called **testicular lobules**
>   - Each lobule contains 1-3 highly coiled **seminiferous tubules** in which **sperms are produced**. 
>   - Each seminiferous tubules is covered with **spermatogonia** and **sertoli cells**.  

- Leydig cells present outside the seminiferous tubules in interstitial spaces and they synthesize and secrete testicular hormones called androgen. 

- Fructose is found in the epididymis that nourishes the sperm. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Male Reproductive Glands 
>   - **Bulbourethral gland**: provides lubrication and basicity to the seminal fluid. 
>   - **Prostate gland**: produce prostatic fluid, which is a milky alkaline secretion that contributes to semen volume. Prostatic fluid contains enzymes, citric acid, and zinc, which help activate sperm and prolong their viability by neutralizing acidic conditions in the female reproductive tract.
>   - **Seminal vesicle**: provides fructose to the newly formed sperms accumulated there allowing motility along with release of calcium and enzymes. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Male accessory ducts 
>   1. **Rete testis**: rete testis serves as a network of tubules within the testicle, acting as a conduit for sperm to travel from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis for maturation and storage. It also helps in maintaining a conducive environment for sperm development by facilitating the exchange of nutrients and waste products.
>   2. **Vasa efferentia**: vasa efferentia are small ducts connecting the rete testis to the epididymis. Their primary function is to transport sperm from the rete testis to the epididymis, where they undergo further maturation and storage. Additionally, they are involved in reabsorption of fluid and secretory products from the testicular fluid, contributing to the concentration and composition of sperm
>   3. **Epididymis**: The epididymis is a coiled tube located on the surface of each testis where sperm from the testes mature and are stored. Its main functions include the maturation of sperm, storage of sperm, and transportation of sperm from the testes to the vas deferens.
>   4. **Vas deferens**: The vas deferens is a muscular tube that extends from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct. Its primary function is to transport mature sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct during ejaculation.

- Some behave like spermatozoa but others do not and provide nutrients. <img align=right width=350 src="../diagram/ch2/spermatogenesis and oogenesis.png">
- Oogenesis starts in the fetal phase and stops temporarily and again starts in puberty.
