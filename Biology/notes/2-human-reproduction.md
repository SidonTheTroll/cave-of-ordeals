# Human Reproduction 

- Humans are **viviparous** 

> [!NOTE]
> - Important events in human reproduction
>   1. **Gametogenesis**: formation of gametes 
>   2. **Insemination**: transfer of sperms to the female genital tract
>   3. **Fertilization**: fusion of male and female gametes
>   4. **Implantation**: formation and development of blastocyst and its attatchment to the uterine wall
>   5. **Gestation**: period of embryonic development 
>   6. **Parturition**: delivery of the baby

> [!TIP]
> Male continues to develop sperms till very old age but females stop ovulating aronud the age of 50. 

# Male Reproductive System 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Characteristics** 
>   1. Located in the pelvic region 
>   2. Includes: pair of testis, accessory ducts, glands and external genitalia. 
>   3. Testis are situated outside the abdominal cavity within a pouch called scrotum. 
>       - Helps to maintain temperature for spermatogenesis (2-2.5$\degree C$ lower than body temperature)
>   4. **Testis**:
>       1. Oval in shape
>       2. **Length**: 4-5 cm 
>       3. **Width**: 2-3 cm 
>   5. Testis is covered by a thick covering 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Testis**
>   - Has about 250 compartments each called **testicular lobules**
>   - Each lobule contains 1-3 highly coiled **seminiferous tubules** in which **sperms are produced**. 
>   - Each seminiferous tubules is covered with **spermatogonia** and **sertoli cells**.  

- Leydig cells present outside the seminiferous tubules in interstitial spaces and they synthesize and secrete testicular hormones called androgen. 

- Fructose is found in the epididymis that nourishes the sperm. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Male Reproductive Glands 
>   - **Bulbourethral gland**: provides lubrication and basicity to the seminal fluid. 
>   - **Prostate gland**: produce prostatic fluid, which is a milky alkaline secretion that contributes to semen volume. Prostatic fluid contains enzymes, citric acid, and zinc, which help activate sperm and prolong their viability by neutralizing acidic conditions in the female reproductive tract.
>   - **Seminal vesicle**: provides fructose to the newly formed sperms accumulated there allowing motility along with release of calcium and enzymes. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Male accessory ducts 
>   1. **Rete testis**: rete testis serves as a network of tubules within the testicle, acting as a conduit for sperm to travel from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis for maturation and storage. It also helps in maintaining a conducive environment for sperm development by facilitating the exchange of nutrients and waste products.
>   2. **Vasa efferentia**: vasa efferentia are small ducts connecting the rete testis to the epididymis. Their primary function is to transport sperm from the rete testis to the epididymis, where they undergo further maturation and storage. Additionally, they are involved in reabsorption of fluid and secretory products from the testicular fluid, contributing to the concentration and composition of sperm
>   3. **Epididymis**: The epididymis is a coiled tube located on the surface of each testis where sperm from the testes mature and are stored. Its main functions include the maturation of sperm, storage of sperm, and transportation of sperm from the testes to the vas deferens.
>   4. **Vas deferens**: The vas deferens is a muscular tube that extends from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct. Its primary function is to transport mature sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct during ejaculation.

- Some behave like spermatozoa but others do not and provide nutrients. <img align=right width=350 src="../diagram/ch2/spermatogenesis and oogenesis.png">
- Oogenesis starts in the fetal phase and stops temporarily and again starts in puberty. 

### Explain the hormonic control of spermatogenesis.

Once the positives are excess in the blood, it signals the brain to spot producing more of the hormone.

# Human Sperm 
The formation of sperm, **spermatogenesis** starts at the age of puberty due to the release of **Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH)** 

- GnRH acts at the pituitary gland and **secretes 2 gonadotropins**
    1. Lutenisign hormone 
    2. Follicle Stimulating Hormone 

> [!NOTE]
> LH acts at Leydig cells and stimulates secretion of androgens which stimulates the process of spermatogenesis.  
>
> FSH acts on Sertoli cells and stimulates secretion of factors which help in the process of spermatogenesis. 

<img align=right src="../diagram/ch2/human-sperm.png" width=350>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. The sperm of made of a tail, middle piece and a head. 
> 2. The anterior portion of the head is covered by acrosome filled with enzymes that help in the fertilization of the ovum. 
> 3. Middle piece contains mitochondria that produce energy for the movement of the tail. 

- A human male ejaculates around 200 to 300 million sperm in one ejaculation.
- For normal fertility, at least 60% of the sperm show normal shape and size with vigorous motility. 

The sperms released from seminiferous ducts are transported to accessory ducts. Sections of epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and prostate are essential for maturation and motility of the sperms. 

> [!NOTE]
> The seminal plasma along with sperms constiture the semen.  
> The functions of male sex accessorg ducts and glands are maintained by the androgens. 

# Female Reproductive System 
The ovaries take their characteristic shape when the female foetus is around 3 months old. 

During this, around **2 million egg-mother** cells are developed in **each ovary** but till the time of puberty, only **a few thousands remain**. 

- Uterus layers
    1. **Perimetrium**: anchors the uterus and serves as a barrier from infections and pathogens. 
    2. **Myometrium**: contracts during delivery which helps to take the fetus out. 
    3. **Endometrium**: provides a nourishing environment for a fertilized egg to implant and develop into a pregnancy. It also sheds during menstruation if no pregnancy occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> **Ectopic Fertilization**
>
> It is a condition when the fertilized eggs implants itself outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube, ovary, cervix or abdominal cavity. 
>
> This is a life-threatening condition which leads infertility. 

- Ovulation generally takes place on the 14th day. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Oogenesis**: formation and maturation of ovum from female germ cell.  
> Couple of million of oogonia are formed before birth.  
> In prophase 1, egg cells are produced and are temporarily stopped at the stage and called **primary oocytes**.   
> Each primary cells are surrounded by Granulosa cells and is called **Primary follicle**.  
> Till the time of puberty, only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles remain in each ovary.

- **Stem cell**: a cell that can develop into any other cell. 

## Structure of Secondary Oocyte 
It is a haploid cell formed when the primary oocyte divides by meiosis-1. The second meiosis division proceeds as far as metaphase but doesn't continue until a sperm fuses with the oocyte. At fertilization, the secondary oocyte undergoes the second meiotic division producing a large cell, the ovum and a small second polar body.

- **Parts of Fallopian Tube** <img align=right width=400 src="../diagram/ch2/oviduct-parts.png">
    1. **Isthmus**: facilitates their gradual release, and assists in the transport of the oocyte, increasing the chances of successful fertilization.
    2. **Ampula**: it is the site where fertilization typically occurs and facilitates the initial stages of the transport of the fertilized egg towards the uterus.
    3. **Infundibulum**: captures the ovulated oocyte and directs it into the oviduct for potential fertilization.
    4. **Fimbriae**: these are finger-like projections at the end of the infundibulum that sweep the ovulated oocyte into the oviduct.
     
> [!NOTE]
> If fertilized, embryo relases hormones that prevent the **breakdown of endometrium**.
