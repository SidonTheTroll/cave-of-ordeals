# Principle of Inheritance and Variation

- **Inheritance**: carrying of genetic characteristics from parents to the offspring is called inheritance. 

> [!WARNING] How is transfer of character possible?  
> It is done via gametes (reproduction).

> [!WARNING] What's in a Gamete?
> DNA in nucleus inside chromosomes. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The copying of DNA takes place in **S-phase**.

- There are 46 chromosomes in our body that make around 30,000 genes. 

**Homologous chromosome**: Two set of similar chromosomes (diploid)

Anaphase it the time when **duplicated genetic material starts separating**.

> [!NOTE]
> To **maintain Ploidy level**, chromosomes are halved in gametes. 

- **Trait**: particular characteristics of an organism based on genetics 
- **Character**: special feature that make an organism different from others of the same species. 

# Central Dogma of Molecular Biology 

$\overset{Replication}{\circlearrowleft}$ DNA $\overset{\text{Transcription}}{\rightarrow}$ RNA $\overset{Translation}{\rightarrow}$ Protein

**Hybridization**: intermixing of character  
**Artificial Hybridization**: controlled reproduction to achieve a specific feature. 

- Genes have specific area to function.

- Gene work types 
    - One gene one function
    - One gene many function
    - Many gene one function

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- **Crossover**: exchange of genetic material which leads to variation.

> [!NOTE]
> **Housekeeping genes**: genes that work 24/7  
> **Temporary work genes**: works one time and then hibernates  
> **One time work genes**: works one time and then destroys itself 

# Mandell's Inheritance 

- Mandell was also known as the **father of inheritance**

Mandell started his genetics experiment on pea plants due to their various characteristics. 

| S.No.  | Characters   | Contrasting Traits   |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 1..  | Stem height   | Tall/dwarf   |
| 2.  | Flower color   | Violet/white   |
| 3.  | Flower position   | Axial/terminal   |
| 4.  | Pod shape   | Inflated/constricted   |
| 5.  | Pod color   | Green/yellow   |
| 6.  | Seed shape   | Round/wrinkled   |
| 7.  | Seed color   | Yellow/Green   |

- **Gene**: Factors that decide the characteristics of an organism. 
- **Artificial hybridization**: crossing two genetically diverse individuals to obtain offspring with the dominant traits.

> [!NOTE]
> A gene might not be seen but it exists supressed in the DNA.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. Genes are represented by alphabets.
> 2. Genes are always occured in pairs.
> 3. To represent one gene for a particular character, we use only one alphabet. 
> 4. During gamete formation, genes get segregated/separted. 

# Monohybrid Cross

![monohybrid-cross](../diagram/ch6/mono-cross.png) 

> [!NOTE]Ratios
> Phenotypic ratio: 3:1  
> Genotypic ratio: 1:2:1

- Alleles are an alternative form of genes 
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- **Homozygous**: TT, tt 
- **Heterozygous**: Tt

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The character which is represented in heterozygous condition is called **dominant trait** and the other **recessive trait**

Almost every experiment Mandell did gave him almost same result.
