# Principle of Inheritance and Variation

- **Inheritance**: carrying of genetic characteristics from parents to the offspring is called inheritance. 

> [!WARNING] How is transfer of character possible?  
> It is done via gametes (reproduction).

> [!WARNING] What's in a Gamete?
> DNA in nucleus inside chromosomes. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The copying of DNA takes place in **S-phase**.

- There are 46 chromosomes in our body that make around 30,000 genes. 

**Homologous chromosome**: Two set of similar chromosomes (diploid)

Anaphase it the time when **duplicated genetic material starts separating**.

> [!NOTE]
> To **maintain Ploidy level**, chromosomes are halved in gametes. 

- **Trait**: particular characteristics of an organism based on genetics 
- **Character**: special feature that make an organism different from others of the same species.

**Hybridization**: intermixing of character  
**Artificial Hybridization**: controlled reproduction to achieve a specific feature. 

- Genes have specific area to function.

- Gene work types 
    - One gene one function
    - One gene many function
    - Many gene one function

- **Crossover**: exchange of genetic material which leads to variation.

> [!NOTE]
> **Housekeeping genes**: genes that work 24/7 
> **Temporary work genes**: works one time and then hibernates 
> **One time work genes**: works one time and then destroys itself
