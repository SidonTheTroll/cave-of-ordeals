# Human Health and Disease 
- **Health**: it is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. 
- A state of good health increases efficiency, productivity and brings economic well being. 
- Health also increases longevity of people and reduces infant and maternal mortality. 

## Ways to ensure Good Health
- Balanced diet
- Regular exercise 
- Vaccination 
- Personal hygiene 
- Awareness about disease
- Maintenance of lifestyle and food intake 

<br>

- Reason of Diseases to Occur 
    - Genetic disorder 
    - Infections 
    - Lifestyle including food and water consumption, rest and exercise given to the body. 

## Pathogenic Diseases 
- Pathogens are the organisms that cause disease in man. These include a variety of bacteria, virus, fungi, etc. 
- All parasites are therefore pathogens as they cause harm to the host by living in (or on) them. 
- The pathogens can enter our body by various means. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Antigen**: Antigens are molecules or substances, typically proteins or polysaccharides, that trigger an immune response by being recognized as foreign by the body's immune system, often leading to the production of antibodies.

## Bacterial Diseases 
### Typhoid 
- Caused by *Salmonella typhi*
- Enters small intestine through contaminated food or water. 
- **Symptoms**: high fever, weakness, stomach pain, constipation, headache, loss of appetite. 
- Intestinal perforation and death in severe case. 
- Typhoid fever could be confirmed by **Widal Test**

### Pneumonia 
- Caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae*
- Person acquires pneumonia by inhaling the droplets (aerosols) released by infected person or sharing utensils. 
- Alveoli is filled with mucus and cells are inflamed. 
- Symptoms: 
    - Fever
    - Chills 
    - Cough
    - Headache
    - Severe case: lips and finger nails turn gray to bluish. 

## Viral Disease 
### Common Cold 
- Caused by *Rhinovirus* pathogen group 
- Affects nose and respiratory tract 
- Symptoms: 
    - Congestion and discharge of mucus 
    - Sore throat 
    - Hoarseness 
    - Cough
    - Headache 
    - Tiredness 
- Lasts 3-7 days 
- Caused by directly inhaled droplets of cough or sneeze from infected person or contaminated objects. 

> [!NOTE]
> Virus is only cured by immune system. Antibiotics are given to avoid secondary symptoms or infection. 

## Protozoan Diseases 
### Malaria 
- Caused by *Plasmodium* (sporozoan) species
    - *P. vivax*
    - *P. malaria*
    - *P. falciparum* (most lethal)
- Spread by female *Anopheles* mosquito. 

#### Life Cycle of Malaria 
1. Infected female *Anopheles* mosquito injects sporozoites into man. 
2. Parasite (sporozoites) travel to the liver through bloodstream. 
3. Parasites reproduce asexually in the liver cells and bursts the cells, releasing into the blood. 
4. Parasites reproduce asexually in RBC, bursting the cell to spread more releasing **hemozoin** in the process. 
5. Gametocytes develop in RBC
6. Female mosquito sucks the infected blood while taking blood meal. 
7. Fertilization takes place inside the mosquito's gut 
8. Mature sporozoites escape the gut and migrate to the mosquito's salivary gland. 
9. Repeat from step 1. 

### Amoebiasis (Amoebic dysentery)
- Symptoms:
    - Constipation 
    - Abdominal pain 
    - Cramps
    - Stool with excess mucus, fluid and blood clots
- Houseflies acts as mechanical vectors. 
    - Transmits the parasite from faeces of infected person to food, food products and water, making them main source of infection. 

### Ascariasis 
- Caused by *Ascaris*, a small intestinal parasite. 
- Symptoms: 
    - Internal bleeding 
    - Muscular pain 
    - Fever 
    - Anemia 
    - Blockage of intestinal passage
- Eggs of ascaris are excreted with faeces of infected person which contaminate soil, water, plants, etc. and can be spread through water, vegetables, fruits, etc. 

### Elephantiasis/Filariasis
- Caused by *Wuchereria bancrofti* and *Wuchereria malayi* that live inside the body for many years in the lymphatic vessels of the lower limbs. 
- Symptoms: 
    - Chronic inflammation and deformities of lower limbs and organs and often also the genitals. 
- Transmitted through bite of female mosquito vectors. 

## Fungal Infection 
### Ringworms 
- Caused by genera *Microsporum*, *Trichophyton* or *Epidermophyton*. 
- Symptoms:
    - Dry, scaly lesions on skin, nails and scalp. 
    - Itching in infected regions 
- Heat and moisture help in the fungal growth 
- Usually thrive in skin folds and between toes. 
- Acquired from soil or by using towels, clothes and comb of infected individuals. 

## Maintenance of Personal Hygiene  
- Personal hygiene is essential in prevention and control of infectious diseases. 

- Measures include keeping body clean, consumption of clean drinking water, food, etc. 

- Public hygiene include proper disposal of waste and excreta, periodic cleaning and disinfection of water reservoirs, pools, cesspools and tanks. 

- Practising standard hygiene in public catering. 
    - Essential for preventing food and water-borne diseases such as typhoid, amoebiasis and ascariasis. 

- In case of air-borne (pneumonia and common cold), 
    - Practice food and water separation along with physical contact with person and their belongings. 

- For mosquito-borne diseases, it is important to control and eliminate the vectors and breeding places. 
    - Achieved by 
        1. Avoiding stagnation of water in residential areas
        2. Using mosquito nets
        3. Introducing fish like *Gambusia* that feed on mosquito larvae
        4. Spraying insecticides in ditches, drainage areas and swamps, etc. 
        5. Doors and windows should be provided with wire mesh to prevent entry of mosquitoes. 

# Immunity 
The ability of the body to defend itself from most foreign agents, especially from diseases-causing organisms is called **immunity**. 

- It has 2 types 
    - **Innate immunity**: The immunity that is present since birth.  
    - **Acquired immunity**: It is the immunity that is acquired after the body is introduced with the pathogen and it develops antibodies against it to prevent it next time. 

## Innate Immunity 
It is the immunity that is present in the time of birth by providing different types of barriers to the entry of foreign agents into our body. 

- It consists of 4 barriers: 
    1. **Physical barriers**: the barrier that is provided by the skin and mucus coating on epithelium lining of respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts prevent microbes from entering. 
    2. **Physiological barriers**: These include stomach acid, saliva in mouth and tears from eyes that prevent microbial growth. 
    3. **Cellular barriers**: certain leukocyte (WBC) like polymorpho-nuclear leukocyte (PMNL-neutrophils), monocytes and natural killer in the blood and macrophages in tissues can phagocytose and destroy the microbes. 
    4. **Cytokine barriers**: virus-infected cells secrete proteins called interferons which protect non-infected cells from further viral infection. 

## Acquired Immunity 
- 2 response of acquired immunity
    - CMI 
    - HIR 

T-Lymphocyte tells B-Lymphocytes produce antibodies. 

- **Immunoglobulin** 
    - **IgA**: Found in mucosal areas (e.g., gut, respiratory tract) and body fluids like saliva, tears and **mother's milk**. It protects against infections by preventing pathogen attachment to cells. 
    - **IgG**: Provides long-term immunity by neutralizing pathogens and toxins. It's the most abundant and can cross the placenta to protect the fetus.
    - **IgE**: Involved in allergic reactions and protects against parasitic infections. It triggers histamine release from mast cells and basophils.
    - **IgM**: The first antibody produced in response to an infection. It helps activate the complement system and is mainly involved in early-stage immune responses. 

### Structure of Antibody 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Antibodies are antigen specific. 

- $H_2L_2$ antibody 
    - Consists of 2 heavy and 2 light chains. 

- Types of T-cell 
    - **T-Helper (CD4+ T-cells)**: Coordinate the immune response by activating other immune cells like B-cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and macrophages. They also secrete cytokines to regulate immune reactions.
    - **T-Cytotoxic (CD8+ T-cells)**: Destroy infected or cancerous cells by recognizing and inducing apoptosis (cell death) in cells presenting foreign antigens.
    - **T-Suppressor (Tregs/Regulatory T-Cells)**: Maintain immune system balance by suppressing excessive immune responses, preventing autoimmune diseases and excessive inflammation.
    - **T-Memory**: Provide long-term immunity by remembering past infections, allowing for a faster and more effective response if the pathogen reappears.

> [!NOTE]
> During HIV, the virus attacks the T-helper cells and antibodies aren't produced which leads to drop in immunity from even the simplest microbes.
