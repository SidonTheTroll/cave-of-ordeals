# Human Health and Disease 
- **Health**: it is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. 
- A state of good health increases efficiency, productivity and brings economic well being. 
- Health also increases longevity of people and reduces infant and maternal mortality. 

## Ways to ensure Good Health
- Balanced diet
- Regular exercise 
- Vaccination 
- Personal hygiene 
- Awareness about disease
- Maintenance of lifestyle and food intake 

<br>

- Reason of Diseases to Occur 
    - Genetic disorder 
    - Infections 
    - Lifestyle including food and water consumption, rest and exercise given to the body. 

## Pathogenic Diseases 
- Pathogens are the organisms that cause disease in man. These include a variety of bacteria, virus, fungi, etc. 
- All parasites are therefore pathogens as they cause harm to the host by living in (or on) them. 
- The pathogens can enter our body by various means. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Antigen**: Antigens are molecules or substances, typically proteins or polysaccharides, that trigger an immune response by being recognized as foreign by the body's immune system, often leading to the production of antibodies.

## Bacterial Diseases 
### Typhoid 
- Caused by *Salmonella typhi*
- Enters small intestine through contaminated food or water. 
- **Symptoms**: high fever, weakness, stomach pain, constipation, headache, loss of appetite. 
- Intestinal perforation and death in severe case. 
- Typhoid fever could be confirmed by **Widal Test**

### Pneumonia 
- Caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae*
- Person acquires pneumonia by inhaling the droplets (aerosols) released by infected person or sharing utensils. 
- Alveoli is filled with mucus and cells are inflamed. 
- Symptoms: 
    - Fever
    - Chills 
    - Cough
    - Headache
    - Severe case: lips and finger nails turn gray to bluish. 

## Viral Disease 
### Common Cold 
- Caused by *Rhinovirus* pathogen group 
- Affects nose and respiratory tract 
- Symptoms: 
    - Congestion and discharge of mucus 
    - Sore throat 
    - Hoarseness 
    - Cough
    - Headache 
    - Tiredness 
- Lasts 3-7 days 
- Caused by directly inhaled droplets of cough or sneeze from infected person or contaminated objects. 

> [!NOTE]
> Virus is only cured by immune system. Antibiotics are given to avoid secondary symptoms or infection. 

## Protozoan Diseases 
### Malaria 
- Caused by *Plasmodium* (sporozoan) species
    - *P. vivax*
    - *P. malaria*
    - *P. falciparum* (most lethal)
- Spread by female *Anopheles* mosquito. 

#### Life Cycle of Malaria 
1. Infected female *Anopheles* mosquito injects sporozoites into man. 
2. Parasite (sporozoites) travel to the liver through bloodstream. 
3. Parasites reproduce asexually in the liver cells and bursts the cells, releasing into the blood. 
4. Parasites reproduce asexually in RBC, bursting the cell to spread more releasing **hemozoin** in the process. 
5. Gametocytes develop in RBC
6. Female mosquito sucks the infected blood while taking blood meal. 
7. Fertilization takes place inside the mosquito's gut 
8. Mature sporozoites escape the gut and migrate to the mosquito's salivary gland. 
9. Repeat from step 1. 

### Amoebiasis (Amoebic dysentery)
- Symptoms:
    - Constipation 
    - Abdominal pain 
    - Cramps
    - Stool with excess mucus, fluid and blood clots
- Houseflies acts as mechanical vectors. 
    - Transmits the parasite from faeces of infected person to food, food products and water, making them main source of infection. 

### Ascariasis 
- Caused by *Ascaris*, a small intestinal parasite. 
- Symptoms: 
    - Internal bleeding 
    - Muscular pain 
    - Fever 
    - Anemia 
    - Blockage of intestinal passage
- Eggs of ascaris are excreted with faeces of infected person which contaminate soil, water, plants, etc. and can be spread through water, vegetables, fruits, etc. 

### Elephantiasis/Filariasis
- Caused by *Wuchereria bancrofti* and *Wuchereria malayi* that live inside the body for many years in the lymphatic vessels of the lower limbs. 
- Symptoms: 
    - Chronic inflammation and deformities of lower limbs and organs and often also the genitals. 
- Transmitted through bite of female mosquito vectors. 

## Fungal Infection 
### Ringworms 
- Caused by genera *Microsporum*, *Trichophyton* or *Epidermophyton*. 
- Symptoms:
    - Dry, scaly lesions on skin, nails and scalp. 
    - Itching in infected regions 
- Heat and moisture help in the fungal growth 
- Usually thrive in skin folds and between toes. 
- Acquired from soil or by using towels, clothes and comb of infected individuals. 

## Maintenance of Personal Hygiene  
- Personal hygiene is essential in prevention and control of infectious diseases. 

- Measures include keeping body clean, consumption of clean drinking water, food, etc. 

- Public hygiene include proper disposal of waste and excreta, periodic cleaning and disinfection of water reservoirs, pools, cesspools and tanks. 

- Practising standard hygiene in public catering. 
    - Essential for preventing food and water-borne diseases such as typhoid, amoebiasis and ascariasis. 

- In case of air-borne (pneumonia and common cold), 
    - Practice food and water separation along with physical contact with person and their belongings. 

- For mosquito-borne diseases, it is important to control and eliminate the vectors and breeding places. 
    - Achieved by 
        1. Avoiding stagnation of water in residential areas
        2. Using mosquito nets
        3. Introducing fish like *Gambusia* that feed on mosquito larvae
        4. Spraying insecticides in ditches, drainage areas and swamps, etc. 
        5. Doors and windows should be provided with wire mesh to prevent entry of mosquitoes. 

# Immunity 
The ability of the body to defend itself from most foreign agents, especially from diseases-causing organisms is called **immunity**. 

- It has 2 types 
    - **Innate immunity**: The immunity that is present since birth.  
    - **Acquired immunity**: It is the immunity that is acquired after the body is introduced with the pathogen and it develops antibodies against it to prevent it next time.
