# Evolution 
- Spontaneous generation of life: Louis Pasteur 
    - Louis Pasteur's experiments in the 19th century disproved the theory of spontaneous generation, demonstrating that life does not arise from non-living matter spontaneously but rather from pre-existing life, using sterilized broth and swan-neck flasks to show that microbes come from the air, not the broth itself.

- **Oparin and Haldane** gave the theory that life on Earth arose from non-living matter through a process of gradual chemical evolution

> Organisms are classified by phylogenetic manner.  
> The most latest evolution is kept in last. 

# Miller's Experiment 
- Chemicals used in the experiment: $CH_4, NH_3, H_2O, H_2$
    - The inorganic substances when struck by electrical discharge, form organic substances like pigments, fatty acids, etc. 

- Only 2000 million years ago, the first cellular form of life originated. 

First life originated via chemical evolution from inanimate matter and by the process of biogenesis gave rise to first form of life. 

# Evidences of Evolution 
1. **Fossil evidence**: preserved fossils of extinct animals.
2. **Embryological evidence**: The shapes of embryos of almost all mammals are indistinguishable. 
3. **Homologous organ**: organs with similar anatomical positions but different functions 
4. **Analogous organ**: organs with different anatomical positions but perform similar functions.

# Species struggles 
- **Interspecific struggle**: competition among individuals of the same species. 
- **intraspecific struggle**: competition among individuals of different species.
