# Evolution 
- Spontaneous generation of life: Louis Pasteur 
    - Louis Pasteur's experiments in the 19th century disproved the theory of spontaneous generation, demonstrating that life does not arise from non-living matter spontaneously but rather from pre-existing life, using sterilized broth and swan-neck flasks to show that microbes come from the air, not the broth itself.

- **Oparin and Haldane** gave the theory that life on Earth arose from non-living matter through a process of gradual chemical evolution

> The most latest evolution is kept in last. 

# Miller's Experiment (1953)
- Chemicals used in the experiment: $CH_4, NH_3, H_2O, H_2$
    - The inorganic substances when struck by electrical discharge, form organic substances like pigments, fatty acids, etc. 

- Only 2000 million years ago, the first cellular form of life originated. 

First life originated via chemical evolution from inanimate matter and by the process of biogenesis gave rise to first form of life. 

# Evidences of Evolution 
1. **Fossil evidence**: preserved fossils of extinct animals.
2. **Embryological evidence**: The shapes of embryos of almost all mammals are indistinguishable. 
3. **Homologous organ**: organs with similar anatomical positions but different functions 
4. **Analogous organ**: organs with different anatomical positions but perform similar functions. 

# Lamarck's Theory of Evolution (Pre-Darwin)
1. **Lamarck's Theory of Evolution (Pre-Darwin)**
   - Proposed by French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.
   - Suggested evolution is driven by the *use and disuse of organs*.
   - Example: Giraffes elongated their necks to reach tall trees for foraging, passing this acquired trait to subsequent generations.
   - This theory of acquired characteristics has been largely discredited.

2. **Concept of Evolution**
   - Evolution can be understood both as a process and as a result:
     - **As a process**: Describes the changes and adaptations over time (e.g., changes in life forms or environment).
     - **As a result**: The success stories we observe today, including both animate and inanimate objects.

3. **Natural Selection**
   - Evolution is often regarded as a consequence of natural selection.
   - Natural selection is a mechanism that drives evolutionary change based on survival and reproduction advantages.

4. **Ambiguity in Definitions**
   - There is still some lack of clarity in distinguishing whether evolution and natural selection are processes themselves or outcomes of unknown processes.

# Malthus's Influence on Darwin
1. **Influence of Thomas Malthus**
   - Darwin was possibly influenced by Malthus's work on population growth and resource limitations.
   - Malthus noted that populations grow exponentially if unchecked, while resources remain limited.

2. **Key Observations Underlying Natural Selection**
   - **Limited Natural Resources**: Resources are finite, creating competition.
   - **Stable Population Size**: Populations generally remain stable in size, except for seasonal fluctuations.
   - **Variability Among Individuals**: No two individuals are exactly alike, even if they appear superficially similar.
   - **Inheritance of Variations**: Most variations within a population are heritable.

3. **Population Growth and Competition**
   - Theoretical population size would grow exponentially if every individual reproduced to their full potential (e.g., bacterial growth).
   - In reality, population sizes are limited due to resource competition, leading to only some individuals thriving.

4. **Darwin's Novel Insight**
   - Variations that are heritable and improve resource utilization (adaptations) enable those individuals to survive and reproduce.
   - Over many generations, the survivors with advantageous traits will leave more progeny, gradually changing population characteristics.
   - This process leads to the emergence of new forms and species over time.

> **To be filled later**

# Species struggles 
- **Interspecific struggle**: competition among individuals of the same species. 
- **Intraspecific struggle**: competition among individuals of different species. 

# Origin and Evolutions of Man
- **Dryopithecus**: more ape-like 
- **Ramapithecus**: more man-like 

- Man-like bones were found in Ethiopia and Tanzania. 
- Man-like primates walked upright in Eastern Africa. 
- 2 mya: australopithecus lived in eastern african grasslands. 
- *Homo habilis* had brain capacity of 600-800 cc. 
    - They hunted with tools but ate fruit 

<br>

- *Homo erectus*
    - Fossils found in Java 
    - Ate meat 
    - 900 cc brain
- *Neanderthal* 
    - 1400 cc brain 
    - Lived near east asia and central asia. 
    - Used hides to protect and buried the dead. 
- *Homo sapiens* 
    - 75000-10000 years ago they arose during the ice age. 
    - Pre-historic cave art developed 18000 years ago. 
    - Agriculture developed 10000 years ago.
