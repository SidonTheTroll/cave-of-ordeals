## Salient Features of DS-DNA 
1. It consists of two polynucleotide chains with a sugar-phosphate backbone and bases projecting inward.
2. The two chains are anti-parallel: one is $5' \rightarrow 3'$ and the other is $3' \rightarrow 5'$.
3. Bases in the strands pair through hydrogen bonds: adenine with thymine (two H-bonds) and guanine with cytosine (three H-bonds). This purine-pyrimidine pairing ensures a uniform distance between the helix strands.
4. The two chains are coiled right-handed. The helix pitch is 3.4 nm with about 10 bp per turn, so the distance between base pairs is approximately 0.34 nm.
5. Base pairs stack on top of each other, adding to the stability of the helix along with hydrogen bonds.

## Chargaff's Rule 
Chargaff's rule states that in DNA, the amount of adenine (A) equals thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) equals cytosine (C). This means A pairs with T and G pairs with C, maintaining a consistent ratio of purines to pyrimidines.

Therefore, Purine to Pyrimidines ratio: 1:1.

# The RNA

>   2. Should be chemically and structurally stable. 
>   3. Should provide scope for slow mutations for volution. 
>   4. Should be able to express itself in the form of 'Mendelian Characters'.  

> [!NOTE]

>   1. It is used as both genetic material and catalyst.
>   2. Some chemicals can only be processed by RNA and not by other enzyme. 
>   3. Essential life processes (metabolism, translation, splicing, etc.) evolved around RNA. 

- RNA directly maintains metabolism due to protein. 

DNA is associated with histone protein because **histone octamer** helps to **wrap DNA compactly**. Since DNA has $-ve$ charge due to phosphate group, histone is positively charged. 

- Nucleosome: contains **Arginine** and **Lysine** amino acids. 

> [!NOTE]
> A nucleosome contains aaround 200 base pair. 

- **Beads-on-string**: a structure seen under Electron Microscope contains beads which are the histone octamers with DNA wrapped around it. Each bead is one nucleosome. 

After staining, darker beads are called **Heterochromatin** and the lighter are **Euchromatin**. 

- **Heterochromatin**: Transcriptionally inactive 
- **Euchromatin**: Transcriptionally active 

In our DNA, 98% of it is non-functional.  
Therefore, heterochromatin is the 98% part.

| Feature             | Heterochromatin                          | Euchromatin                           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Structure**       | Tightly packed                           | Loosely packed                        |
| **Staining**        | Darkly stained (with Giemsa stain)       | Lightly stained (with Giemsa stain)   |
| **Gene Activity**   | Generally inactive (gene-poor regions)   | Generally active (gene-rich regions)  |
| **Location**        | Often found at the periphery of the nucleus | Dispersed throughout the nucleus      |
| **DNA Sequence**    | Contains repetitive DNA sequences        | Contains unique DNA sequences         |
| **Function**        | Structural role, maintaining chromosome stability and regulating gene expression | Active role in transcription and gene regulation |
| **Replication Timing** | Late S phase                           | Early S phase                         |

# Replication of DNA 
- Replication of DNA takes place in the **S-Phase** of interphase. 

- Components required to make DNA
    1. Nucleotide 
        1. Phosphate group 
        2. Pentose sugar 
        3. Nitrogenous bases (A, T, C, G)
    2. Energy (From ATP)
    3. Enzymes 
        1. **DNA Dependent DNA Polymerase**: synthesizes a new DNA strand using an existing DNA strand as a template during DNA replication. It ensures the accurate duplication of the genetic material, enabling cell division and the transmission of genetic information to daughter cells.
        2. **Topoisomerase**: relieve tension in DNA during replication and transcription by cutting and rejoining the DNA strands, preventing the DNA from becoming too twisted or tangled.
        3. **Helicase**: unwinds the DNA double helix into single strands, making it possible for replication and transcription to occur.
        4. **Primase**: creates a short RNA primer on a DNA strand, providing a starting point for DNA polymerase to begin DNA synthesis during replication.
    4. Primer (Short strand of RNA)

- 2 enzymes are required to dissolve DNA and break the helix. 

<img align=right src="../diagram/ch5/dna-replication.png" width=700>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DNA replication starts in the place called **Ori** (Origin of Replication) that develops into a Y-shaped structure called **Fork of Replication**.

To remove all H-bonds, huge energy is required and not sufficiently present in the cell. Therefore, a Replication fork opens where the synthesis of DNA occurs. 

During replication, the nitrogenous bases combine with ATP to form the following Triosephosphates that provide energy. 

- $\text{dAMP} + ATP\ \rightarrow ATP \text{ (Adenine triphosphate)}$
- $\text{dTMP} + ATP\ \rightarrow TTP \text{ (Thymine triphosphate)}$
- $\text{dCMP} + ATP\ \rightarrow CTP \text{ (Cytosine triphosphate)}$
- $\text{dGMP} + ATP\ \rightarrow GTP \text{ (Guanine triphosphate)}$

Now, DNA polymerase brings the complementary nucleotide and places it with the complementary base pair. 

- Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate
    - Acts as substrate 
    - Provide energy for polymerization 

> [!NOTE]
> Direction of synthesis: $5' \rightarrow 3'$ 

<img src="../diagram/ch5/dna-replication-1.png">

- The above shows the **semi-conservative method of DNA replication**, i.e., one part is old and the other is new. It consists of **2 DNA and 4 strands**. 

After the synthesis is over, RNA primers are removed from DNA and Okazaki fragments are joined then Ligase establishes bonds between them. 

- **Proof-reading**: mismatches are removed from DNA and correct bases are placed. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Rate of polymerization**: 2000 base pair per second

# Transcription 
It is the process of forming DNA-dependent RNA

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Requirements for making RNA 
>   1. RNA nucleotide (Pentose sugar, nitrogenous bases, phosphate group)
>   2. DNA 
>   3. RNA polymerase 

> [!NOTE]
> The entire DNA doesn't form RNA. 

<img align=right width=500 src="../diagram/ch5/transcription-unit.png">

> [!NOTE]
> - $3'-5'$: template strand has structure gene and copies over to the DNA
> - $5'-3'$: coding strand that doesn't has any info about amino acid. 

### Why don't both the DNA strands transcribe? 
1. Both strands are complementary 
    - If both strands are used in RNA making, it makes them complementary. This has a huge chance of making **double-stranded RNA** which doesn't function as regular mRNA in protein synthesis. 
2. Two different proteins will form. 
    - Creates chaos in the cellular environment because there'll be two instructions for one protein and this causes the formation of proteins that aren't expected to be in that place at that specific time.

> [!NOTE]
> - Types of Transcription
>   1. **Eukaryotic transcription**: takes place in nucleus.
>   2. **Prokaryotic transcription**: takes place in nucleoid (region in prokaryotic cell where genetic material is located, not enclosed by a membrane).

## Transcription in Prokaryotes
<img align=right width=450 src="../diagram/ch5/transcription-in-bacteria.PNG">

1. **Initiation**
    1. **Promoter recognition**: the RNA-polymerase holoenzyme (core enzyme + sigma factor) binds to the promoter sequence in the DNA. 
    2. **Formation of Transcription Bubble**: RNA polymerase unwinds the DNA, creating a transcription bubble that exposes the template strand. 
    3. **Synthesis of initial nucleotides**: RNA polymerase begins synthesizing the first few RNA nucleotides. After about 10 nucleotides, the sigma factor is released, allowing the core enzyme to proceed with elongation.
2. **Elongation**
    1. **RNA Chain Extension**: The core RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand, adding complementary ribonucleotides (rNTPs) in the 5' to 3' direction. The transcription bubble moves with the polymerase as it progresses.
    2. **Proofreading**: RNA polymerase pauses and backtracks to remove incorrectly incorporated nucleotides, ensuring accuracy in RNA synthesis.
3. **Termination**
    1. **Rho-Dependent Termination**: The rho protein binds to the rut site on the nascent RNA and moves towards the RNA polymerase. Upon reaching the transcription complex, rho unwinds the RNA-DNA hybrid, releasing the RNA transcript and disassembling the transcription machinery.
    2. **Rho-Independent Termination**: Specific sequences in the RNA form a stable hairpin structure followed by uracil residues. This causes RNA polymerase to pause, and the weak A-U base pairing leads to the release of the RNA transcript and termination of transcription.

> [!NOTE]
> - Direction of RNA synthesis: $5'-3'$
> 
> Note that this is the same as the synthesis of DNA. 

## Eukaryotic Transcription
<img align=right width=400 src='../diagram/ch5/transcription-in-eukaryotes.jpg'>

1. **Initiation**
    1. **Promoter Recognition and Pre-Initiation Complex Formation:** Transcription factors (TFs) bind to the promoter regions (TATA box at -25) and recruit RNA polymerase II. Additional TFs and mediator proteins assemble to form the pre-initiation complex, positioning RNA polymerase II at the transcription start site.
    2. **DNA Unwinding and Transcription Bubble Formation:** RNA polymerase II, along with TFs, unwinds a small portion of the DNA, creating a transcription bubble that exposes the template strand.
    3. **Synthesis of Initial RNA Nucleotides:** RNA polymerase II begins synthesizing RNA. After the synthesis of around 25 nucleotides, it transitions to elongation mode and the TFs are released.
2. **Elongation**
    1. **RNA Chain Extension:** RNA polymerase II moves along the DNA template strand, adding ribonucleotides (rNTPs) complementary to the DNA template in a 5' to 3' direction. The transcription bubble moves with the polymerase.
    2. **RNA Processing:** As RNA polymerase II synthesizes the RNA, it simultaneously undergoes capping (addition of a 5' cap), splicing (removal of introns), and polyadenylation (addition of a poly-A tail) with the help of various processing factors.
3. **Termination**
    1. **Cleavage and Polyadenylation:** RNA polymerase II transcribes the polyadenylation signal sequence (AAUAAA), and the RNA transcript is cleaved downstream of this site.
    2. **Release of RNA Transcript:** After cleavage, a poly-A tail is added to the 3' end of the RNA. RNA polymerase II continues transcribing for a short distance before dissociating from the DNA, effectively terminating transcription.

## Differences between Transcription in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
| **Aspect**                  | **Prokaryotic Transcription**                                          | **Eukaryotic Transcription**                                               |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RNA Polymerase**          | Single RNA polymerase (holoenzyme with sigma factor)                    | Three RNA polymerases (I, II, III) with RNA polymerase II for mRNA        |
| **Promoter Recognition**    | Sigma factor recognizes -10 (Pribnow box) and -35 regions               | General transcription factors (TFs) and TATA box at -25                   |
| **Initiation Complex**      | Simple; RNA polymerase holoenzyme binds directly to DNA                 | Complex; pre-initiation complex with multiple TFs and mediator proteins   |
| **DNA Unwinding**           | RNA polymerase unwinds DNA to form transcription bubble                 | TFs and RNA polymerase II unwind DNA to form transcription bubble         |
| **Elongation**              | RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA while proofreading                       | RNA polymerase II synthesizes RNA with concurrent capping, splicing, and polyadenylation |
| **RNA Processing**          | No processing; transcription and translation are coupled                | Extensive processing; 5' capping, splicing, and 3' polyadenylation        |
| **Termination**             | Rho-dependent or rho-independent mechanisms                             | Cleavage and polyadenylation signals; RNA polymerase II dissociates after transcribing downstream |
| **Transcription Site**      | Cytoplasm                                                               | Nucleus                                                                   |
| **Transcript Stability**    | mRNA generally has a short half-life                                     | mRNA is more stable due to processing and poly-A tail                     |
| **Regulation Complexity**   | Less complex; primarily involves sigma factors and simple repressors    | Highly complex; involves enhancers, silencers, insulators, and various TFs|

> [!NOTE]
> - **Cistron**: segment of DNA coded for polypeptide (has info about protein)
> - **Exon**: functional part of mRNA 
> - **Intron**: non-functional part of mRNA
> - **Monocistorn**: it is an mRNA in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes carries the coding sequence for a single protein, allowing for focused and regulated expression of individual genes.
> - **Polyciston**: - it is an mRNA in prokaryotes is a single transcript containing the coding sequences for multiple proteins, transcribed from a single operon and translated into distinct polypeptides by ribosomes.

# Translation 
It is the conversion of **mRNA** to **protein**.  <img align=right src="../diagram/ch5/Genetic-Code.webp" width=400>

Protein is a **biomacromolecule** and a **polymer**. 

- There are **64 codons** present **3** of which are known as **nonsense, termination or stop codon**

> [!NOTE]
> It means 61 are coded for amino acids and the rest 3 are coded for termination of the code, namely, **UAA, UAG, UGA**.
> And the sequence of the code is started by **AUG** that also forms **methionine**. 
>
> Therefore **AUG** has dual role, to **start the sequence of protein synthesis** and also to **form methionine**

## Salient Features of Genetic Code  
1. The codon is triplet. 61 codons code for amino acids and 3 codons do not code for any amino acids, hence they function as stop codons.
2. Some amino acids are coded by more than one codon, hence the code is degenerate.
3. The codon is read in mRNA in a contiguous fashion. There are no punctuations.
4. The code is nearly universal: for example, from bacteria to human UUU would code for Phenylalanine (phe). Some exceptions to this rule have been found in mitochondrial codons, and in some protozoans.
5. AUG has dual functions. It codes for Methionine (met), and it also acts as the initiator codon.
6. UAA, UAG, UGA are stop terminator codons.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **George Gamow**, a physicist, made a significant and bold proposition in the field of genetics by suggesting that the genetic code should be composed of combinations of bases to account for the 20 amino acids. He theorized that a code made up of three nucleotides would be necessary, as the permutation combination of four bases taken three at a time (4³) would generate 64 codons, which is more than enough to encode all the amino acids. His interdisciplinary approach and innovative thinking played a crucial role in advancing the understanding of the genetic code, highlighting the collaborative effort needed from various scientific disciplines to decipher the complexities of genetic information.

# Mutations and Genetic Code 
- **Frame-Shift Mutation**: this is a type of mutation where the addition or deletion of one code leads to the distortion of the whole mRNA. 

> [!NOTE]
> - **Original**: SAM HAS RED CAP 
> - **Addition**: SAM PHA SRE DCA P 
> - **Deletion**: SAM ASR EDC AP

# Lac Operon 
- The explanation of lac-operon was a result of close association between geneticist, **Francois Jacod** and biochemist, **Jacque Monod**. 

- Points <img align=right src="../diagram/ch5/lac-operon.jpg">
    - **p**: Promoter
    - **i**: Repressor
    - **o**: Operator
    - **z, y, a**: Structural gene 
        1. **z**: $\beta$-galactosidase
            - Convert lactose into galactose and glucose.
        2. **y**: Permease 
            - Helps the enzyme to permeate into the blood cells which help to speed up the process in other parts too. 
        3. **a**: Transacetylase
            - Its function is not perfectly discovered yet. 

The regulation of lac-operon by repressor is referred to as **negative regulation** because the repressor gene keeps producing which stops the structural gene containing z, y & a from transcribing. This is done so to prevent the production of unnecessary enzymes and save energy.

When lactose is absent, the repressor transcripts into **repressor mRNA** which forms a **Repressor protein** that binds with operator that doesn't allow RNA-polymerase to bind and transcribe the rest of the structural DNA. Here, the **Operator is turned off**

But when lactose is present, it binds with the formed repressor protein that stops it from joining with the operator. This leads to the RNA-polymerase doing its work in producing mRNA from the structural gene that forms **lac-mRNA**. Here, the **Operator is turned on**.  
Lac-mRNA forms **3 enzymes**, $\beta$-galactosidase, permease and transacetylase. 

# Human Genome Project 

> [!NOTE]
> - **Silent Mutation**: a mutation is occured in the DNA but the phenotype remains regular.  
> If a mutation is on a non-coding string, minor changes are unnoticable but major changes may be seen. 

The **Human Genome Project** (HGP) was an international research initiative aimed at mapping and understanding all the genes of the human species. The project **officially started in 1990 and was completed in 2003** (13 years). It was one of the largest collaborative scientific endeavors in history, involving scientists from around the world.

The human genome has approximately $3\times 10^9$ base pairs and the cost of sequencing each bp is about $9 and the total cost estimated for the project was $9 billion. 

If it were to be written on a book with 1000 pages with 1000 letters each, it'd take 3300 such books to document the project. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the success of HGP, it led to the development of a new branch called **Bioinformatics**. 

## Goals of HGP 
1. Identify all the approximately 20,000-25,000 genes in the human DNA. 
2. Determine the sequences of the 3 million chemical base pairs that make up human DNA. 
3. Store this information in databases. 
4. Improve tools for data analysis. 
5. Transfer related technologies to other sectors, such as industries. 
6. Address the ethical, legal, and social issues that may arise from the project. 

The project was coordinated by the **US Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health**. Countries like **Japan, France, Germany, China** and others were involved in it. 

Many non-human genome projects were completed before it like on **yeast, *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila*, rice and *Arabidopsis***.

## Methodologies 
There were two major approaches:
1. **Expressed Sequence Tags:** Identifying all the genes that are expressed as RNA 
2. **Sequence Annotation:** SEquence the whole set of genomes that contained all the coding and non-coding sequences and later assign different regions in the sequence with functions.

For the project, every piece of the DNA was cut with **molecular scissors** and stored in vectors with modified DNA and preserved in different mediums in spore form for long viability as in the case of **Gene banks**.  
The commonly used hosts were **BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes)** and **YAC (Yeast Artificial Chromosomes)**

The fragments were sequences using automated DN Asequencers that worked on the principle of a method developed by **Frederick Sanger** who is also credited. 

## Salient Features of Human Genome 
1. The human genome contains 3164.7 million bp. 
2. The average gene consists of 3000 bases, but sizes vary greatly with the largest known human gene being **dystrophin** at 2.4 million bases. 
3. The total number of genes is estimated at 30,000 much lower than previous estimates of 80,000-140,000 genes. 99.9% of the nucleotide bases are exactly the same in all people. 
4. The **functions are unknown** for over **50% of the discovered genes**. 
5. Less than **2%** of the genome **code for protein**. 
6. Repeated sequences make up a very large portion of the human genome. 
7. **Repetitive sequences** are stretches of DNA sequences that are repeated many times, sometimes a hundred to thousand times. They are thought to have **no direct coding function**, but they shed light on **chromosome structure, dynamics and evolution**. 
8. **Chromosome 1** has the most genes (2968), and **Y** has the least (231). 
9. Scientists have identified about 1.4 million locations where single-base DNA differences (**SNPs - single nucleotide Polymorphism (Variation)**) occur in humans. This information promises to revolutionize the process of finding chromosomal locations for disease-associated sequences and tracing human history.
