# Molecular Basis of Inheritance 

# The DNA 

![Central dogma of molecular biology](../diagram/ch5/central-dogma.png)

The **Central Dogma of Molecular Biology** was given by **Francis Crick in 1957** and published in 1958.  

DNA replication takes place in the S-phase of the interphase.

## Salient Features of DS-DNA 
1. It consists of two polynucleotide chains with a sugar-phosphate backbone and bases projecting inward.
2. The two chains are anti-parallel: one is $5' \rightarrow 3'$ and the other is $3' \rightarrow 5'$.
3. Bases in the strands pair through hydrogen bonds: adenine with thymine (two H-bonds) and guanine with cytosine (three H-bonds). This purine-pyrimidine pairing ensures a uniform distance between the helix strands.
4. The two chains are coiled right-handed. The helix pitch is 3.4 nm with about 10 bp per turn, so the distance between base pairs is approximately 0.34 nm.
5. Base pairs stack on top of each other, adding to the stability of the helix along with hydrogen bonds.

## Chargaff's Rule 
Chargaff's rule states that in DNA, the amount of adenine (A) equals thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) equals cytosine (C). This means A pairs with T and G pairs with C, maintaining a consistent ratio of purines to pyrimidines.

Therefore, Purine to Pyrimidines ratio: 1:1.

# The RNA 
<img align=right width=300 src="../diagram/ch5/mRNA.jpg">

- It is the first genetic material.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Full from: **Ribonucleic acid**  
> It is a **single strand of polynucleotide**.
> - **Components**
>     - Ribose sugar (pentose sugar)
>     - Phosphate group 
>     - Nitrogenous base (A,U,C,G) 

> [!NOTE] 
> - Type of RNA 
>   1. **mRNA**: carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosome for protein synthesis.
>   2. **tRNA**: brings amino acid from amino acide pool to ribosome.
>   3. **rRNA**: forms ribosome along with protein. 

> [!TIP]
> - mRNA
>   - 3 nucleotides make one **codon**
>   - **One codon** represents **one amino acid**.  
>   - 20 amino acids are represented by 61 codon. 
> - tRNA 
>   - **3 consecutive bases of tRNA** are called **anticodon**

| | **DNA** | **RNA** | 
|-|-|-|
| **Strands** | It is double stranded. | It is single stranded.| 
| **Sugar** | Sugar is deoxyribose. | Sugar is ribose. | 
| **Bases** | Adenine, **Thymine**, Cytosine, Guanine | Adenine, **Uracil**, Cytosine, Guanine. |

> [!NOTE]
> RNA is the first evolved genetic material but DNA is more stable. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> - Criteria for Genetic Material
>   1. Should be able to replicate
>   2. Should be chemically and structurally stable. 
>   3. Should provide scope for slow mutations for volution. 
>   4. Should be able to express itself in the form of 'Mendelian Characters'.  

> [!NOTE]
> - RNA is the first genetic material because: 
>   1. It is used as both genetic material and catalyst.
>   2. Some chemicals can only be processed by RNA and not by other enzyme. 
>   3. Essential life processes (metabolism, translation, splicing, etc.) evolved around RNA. 

- RNA directly maintains metabolism due to protein. 

DNA is associated with histone protein because **histone octamer** helps to **wrap DNA compactly**. Since DNA has $-ve$ charge due to phosphate group, histone is positively charged. 

- Nucleosome: contains **Arginine** and **Lysine** amino acids. 

> [!NOTE]
> A nucleosome contains aaround 200 base pair. 

- **Beads-on-string**: a structure seen under Electron Microscope contains beads which are the histone octamers with DNA wrapped around it. Each bead is one nucleosome. 

After staining, darker beads are called **Heterochromatin** and the lighter are **Euchromatin**. 

- **Heterochromatin**: Transcriptionally inactive 
- **Euchromatin**: Transcriptionally active 

In our DNA, 98% of it is non-functional.  
Therefore, heterochromatin is the 98% part.

| Feature             | Heterochromatin                          | Euchromatin                           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|

| **Staining**        | Darkly stained (with Giemsa stain)       | Lightly stained (with Giemsa stain)   |
| **Gene Activity**   | Generally inactive (gene-poor regions)   | Generally active (gene-rich regions)  |
| **Location**        | Often found at the periphery of the nucleus | Dispersed throughout the nucleus      |
| **DNA Sequence**    | Contains repetitive DNA sequences        | Contains unique DNA sequences         |
| **Function**        | Structural role, maintaining chromosome stability and regulating gene expression | Active role in transcription and gene regulation |
| **Replication Timing** | Late S phase                           | Early S phase                         |
