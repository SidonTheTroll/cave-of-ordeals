# Molecular Basis of Inheritance 

# The DNA 

![Central dogma of molecular biology](../diagram/ch5/central-dogma.png)

The **Central Dogma of Molecular Biology** was given by **Francis Crick in 1957** and published in 1958.  

DNA replication takes place in the S-phase of the interphase.

- DNA is found in nucleus (chromosomal DNA) and plastid and mitochondria.

## Salient Features of DS-DNA 
1. It consists of two polynucleotide chains with a sugar-phosphate backbone and bases projecting inward.
2. The two chains are anti-parallel: one is $5' \rightarrow 3'$ and the other is $3' \rightarrow 5'$.
3. Bases in the strands pair through hydrogen bonds: adenine with thymine (two H-bonds) and guanine with cytosine (three H-bonds). This purine-pyrimidine pairing ensures a uniform distance between the helix strands.
4. The two chains are coiled right-handed. The helix pitch is 3.4 nm with about 10 bp per turn, so the distance between base pairs is approximately 0.34 nm.
5. Base pairs stack on top of each other, adding to the stability of the helix along with hydrogen bonds.

## Chargaff's Rule 
Chargaff's rule states that in DNA, the amount of adenine (A) equals thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) equals cytosine (C). This means A pairs with T and G pairs with C, maintaining a consistent ratio of purines to pyrimidines.

Therefore, Purine to Pyrimidines ratio: 1:1.
