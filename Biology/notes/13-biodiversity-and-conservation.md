# Biodiversity and Conservation 
1. Enormous Diversity of Life: The sheer variety of species on Earth, including specific examples like
    - **Ants**: more than 20,000 species 
    - **Beetles**: more than 300,000 species 
    - **Fish**: more than 28,000 species
    - **Orchids**: Nearly 20,000 species

- **Diversification**: process by which a single species evolves into multiple distinct species or forms, often as a result of adapting to different environments or ecological niches. This process increases biodiversity and contributes to the variety of life on Earth.

> **Q/ Role of biodiversity in the functioning of ecosystems and the biosphere.**
> > Biodiversity plays a crucial role in the functioning of an ecosystem by enhancing its stability, productivity, and resilience. A diverse range of species ensures that ecosystems can provide essential services such as nutrient cycling, pollination, water purification, and climate regulation. Greater biodiversity also helps ecosystems adapt to environmental changes and disturbances, ensuring long-term sustainability and balance.

> **Q/ Why is biodiversity required in an ecosystem?**
> > Communities with more species tend to be more stable than that with less species that was confirmed by Davis Tilman.
