# Biodiversity and Conservation 
1. Enormous Diversity of Life: The sheer variety of species on Earth, including specific examples like
    - **Ants**: more than 20,000 species 
    - **Beetles**: more than 300,000 species 
    - **Fish**: more than 28,000 species
    - **Orchids**: Nearly 20,000 species

- **Diversification**: process by which a single species evolves into multiple distinct species or forms, often as a result of adapting to different environments or ecological niches. This process increases biodiversity and contributes to the variety of life on Earth.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Q/ Role of biodiversity in the functioning of ecosystems and the biosphere.**
> > Biodiversity plays a crucial role in the functioning of an ecosystem by enhancing its stability, productivity, and resilience. A diverse range of species ensures that ecosystems can provide essential services such as nutrient cycling, pollination, water purification, and climate regulation. Greater biodiversity also helps ecosystems adapt to environmental changes and disturbances, ensuring long-term sustainability and balance.

# Biodiversity 


> [!NOTE]
> **Q/ Why is biodiversity required in an ecosystem?**
> > Communities with more species tend to be more stable than that with less species that was confirmed by Davis Tilman. 

- Characteristics of a stable community: 
    1. Productivity should not vary too much year to year. 
    2. In should be resistant to occasional natural and man-made disturbances. 
    3. It should be resistant to invasion by foreign species.

### Rivet Popper Hypothesis by Paul Ehrlich 
1. Assumes the ecosystem to be an airplane and the species to the rivets joining all parts together. 
2. If every passenger pops a rivet to take home (resulting species extinction), it may not effect the flight safety initially (proper ecosystem functioning).
3. When with time as more rivets are removed the plane becomes dangerously weak and fatal to the life of other species. 

### Loss of Biodiversity 
- The colonization of tropical pacific island by humans has led to extinction of more than 2000 native bird species. 
- IUCN RED List (2004) enlists the extinction of 784 species in the last 500 years.
